The mod-team thought it would be a good idea to do a mid-year check-in too so here we go.\n\n# Softened rules and enforcement  \n\nWe\'ve made small rules adjustments, or tweaked how we\'re enforcing rules. This includes allowing more picture posts, letting downvotes take care of what the community does and doesn\'t want to see. We\'ve also allowed Toronto related questions here a lot more, rather than diverting them all to r/askTO. Seems like these changes have been going alright so far. Still some minor adjustments for the community and mods to get used to but all-in-all no big problems noticed.\n\nWe\'ve also been adjusting our enforcement on headline rules. Officially the rule still says no editorialized headlines but enforcement wise, we\'ve been a little more lax when headlines are adjusted to remove clickbait in them. for example if the headline is ""you won\'t believe which bar got raided by the cops last night!"" we probably wouldn\'t mind if you changed it to include the name of whichever bar it was. But if you\'re changing it in other ways, that might inject opinion for example, then we\'d probably ask you to fix that. So to summarize, while editorializing headlines is generally still against the rules, we may provide exceptions if you are simply making it not clickbait.\n\n# AMAs \n\nWe\'re still working to bring you more of these. They\'ve gone well so far. We had a huge one with Mayor Olivia Chow in January, which went well. We did have significant issues with brigading there, which was a bit of work for the mod team to deal with but we have some adjustments in mind that will make it smoother in the future, so good learnings all-in-all. That was definitely our biggest AMA to date. If you know of anybody who might make for a good AMA here, or of you want to volunteer to help coordinate some for us, send over a [modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftoronto&subject=&message=). We could always use more volunteers!\n\n# Increased transparency \n\nWe\'re trying to make sure to more consistently leave comments when a thread is locked or removed to explain (even if briefly) why that action was taken, to help you understand what is going on, since last time we talked we heard some frustrations about how it felt arbitrary. This feels like a positive change so far so we\'ll keep doing it but if there is a thread where we miss that, please feel free to let us know so we can remedy it.\n\n# Ongoing moderation concerns\n\nThe mod team is still dealing with a very significant amount of racism in the community. While we frequently encounter bigotry of all types, there has been a particular uptick in racism worth noting here including targeting South Asians and other communities. We have a low tolerance here for incivility in general, but any instances of hate or bigotry will be dealt with harshly. If you see posts or comment of concern against any group in this regard, please report them so we can more swiftly take action. Users that incite violence or promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned. There will not be debate or additional warnings - You all agreed to these rules when you created your reddit account.\n\n# New and Alternate Subs\n\n* r/missedConnectionsTO **(NEW!)** is there to reconnect you with that person that passed you by\n* r/askTO is great for asking personal questions of other Toronto redditors\n* r/toRANTo is there for when you just need to let out all your complaints\n* r/VolunteerToronto has info for volunteer opportunities in and around the city\n* r/LostAndFoundTO helps you look for missing stuff or it\'s owner\n* r/frugalTO will help you save some money\n* r/toronto_ontario if you like crime posts and different moderation\n* r/FoodToronto is a great place to talk about all the food the city has to offer.', 'score': 8, 'num_comments': 21, 'created_utc': datetime.datetime(2025, 6, 1, 8, 3, 22), 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1l0naup/2025_community_midyear_checkin/', 'author': 'AutoModerator', 'upvote_ratio': 0.62, 'event_type': 'community', 'venues_mentioned': [], 'dates_mentioned': [], 'sentiment_score': 0.1645959595959596, 'buzz_score': 30.8, 'mood_tags': ['Community', 'Romantic', 'Evening', 'Social', 'Free'], 'is_event_post': True}"
