I also had a similar salary and lived in a very very blue, high cost of living and state like Washington with similar political environments. 

Health insurance - your job will likely provide very good health insurance where you have to pay little to nothing out of pocket. White collar jobs generally have very good health insurance unless you’re at a start up. Two big caveats here though that are difficult to truly grasp unless you’ve lived in this system: 1. your health insurance is entirely tied to your job. If you get fired with no severance at the end of the month and get hit by a bus on the 1st, you could suddenly be hundreds of thousands in medical debt. My parents also had great health insurance, until my mom got cancer and had to retire before Medicare (state insurance for elderly) kicked in. My dad worked until age 75 to be able to pay for her cancer treatments and avoid leaving us in debt. He died a month after he stopped working. 2. It’s complicated. It’s a bitch to navigate. In network, out of network, HMO, PPO, referrals. Your HR should help you navigate this but it’s truthfully just annoying. For someone who’s never navigated it either, your HR isn’t going to always be a truly straight source (especially if you change jobs or are considering offers and are trying to compare benefit packages and costs… they’re probably going to oversell its value and undersell how much it’s actually going to cost you. You have to do independent research.)

Political situation- I think other comments do a good job detailing this, but just to reiterate - it’s, uh, not good! Blue states are *somewhat* insulated but not that much… this administration is trampling over states rights and judicial law, so one of the most terrifying things right now is how little power blue states really have. Before I moved I was on the emergency pick up list for 4 of my neighbors school kids in case there were raids. The economic situation is more tenuous than ever - so job security anywhere is not solid. I know I sound alarmist but I have to admit when I hear people consider moving to the US right now sometimes I think I hear “should I move to Germany in 1933?” 

Maybe a lesser but still something to think about longer term: Raising a family here is tough. I had a direct comparison to my sibling raising my nephews across the border while I was raising my kiddos. My state and Washington are one of only six states that give 12 weeks paid leave for new parents - but that’s it. We paid $2600/month for an infant in daycare. With a toddler and preschooler it was $3800/month. It’d be slightly higher in Seattle. In state tuition per year at a good state university is $30,000/year. Even in blue states, even in the same school district, schools are mostly funded by property tax so there is massive amounts of education inequity - even more than in Canada. Your health insurance may be good now for individuals but may start to escalate if you have a family. Guns (not much more to be said there.)

\- Expect to pay more for healthcare. That won't eradicate the benefits of the salary boost, but FYI even when your employer offers for insurance, they subsidize the plan amounts but often don't fully cover it. So for example, there is a 'free' plan, and then monthly cost plans. I pay about 100-200ish a month for my plan via my employer, and then pay 35 copay per visit, plus then, pay for services like ultrasounds up until my deductible is met. It's not terrible if you're reasonably healthy and the plan is ok, but, if you have any recurring medications you take, a history of anything in your family, etc., it'd be worthwhile to check how must that will run you. (Also, having a baby costs like 10k in hospitals here? Take that into account if you want kids...)

\- Seattle and Toronto have very different vibes as cities, and you're going to meet very different people. Toronto is more like New York, US-city wise. Seattle is sorta like Vancouver, but with more big tech people (Amazon, Microsoft) than Vancouver. I know some people who have moved to Seattle and it took them a long time to find friends-- hard to find people into the same stuff, etc. But, if you're super outdoorsy, lots of folks into that there!

\- The weather in Seattle will be warmer but I've heard it rains and is gray a lot. If the Toronto winters get you down, the Seattle gray season (aka most of the year) may not be much of an improvement.

\- For the first year, you'll pay taxes to US and Canada (not in full-- there is a trade agreement, but with Trump... who knows what will happen with that.) After that, just US. But then, your Canadian bank accounts will count as 'foreign investments'. If you have a lot of money in mutual funds etc, prepare to get rid of all of it, or get taxed like crazy. You'll need to open 401k etc here in the US, and then if you ever want to move back, deal with moving it over. Not impossible, just a hassle.

\- Being in the US right now is... weird vibes. I've been where for awhile but being on a visa and knowing I could be deported at a moment's notice, if my company say has layoffs or if the administration has a whim... It's a low undercurrent of constant stress.

So if you ever do have to go for diagnostics or something urgent you will be out of pocket for more than you would expect.

Make sure you establish non residency in Canada for tax purposes by closing bank accounts, ending any leases, etc. you can keep your tfsa accounts and rrsps, you obviously can’t contribute to them when you’re in the US though, and also note that TFSA isn’t recognized in the US tax code so you’ll have to pay US tax on any realized earnings in your TFSA (dividends etc even if you don’t sell any holdings). If you do end up in the US permanently you’ll have to essentially pay tax on it when you move it over but I wouldn’t worry about that yet. 

It’s worth paying a cross border accountant especially the first year you file because you’ll have to file the stub year in both.

second will be figuring out a place to live; without credit score you'll be very limited, some apartment complexes specifically target expats and only require proof of employment but you'll have to dig around to find those. you could also look for a roommate situation, or ask your employer what kind of housing assistance they can offer.

if you have/want kids, private school is pretty much the only option - consider the 10-30K/yr cost of that. plus college/university is stupid expensive, too. 2 kids + healthcare will prob be between $60K-80K USD/yr, for example. if you want a nice home in a nice neighbourhood, add HOA fees, 3-800/M, so another 4-10K/yr. about total $65-90K/yr, depending where in the 'middle class' spectrum you want to be. that puts your salary increase at $75-100K ignoring taxes, as in Washington it'll be roughly about the same.

Obviously the Trump stuff is horrific and terrifying, and it would be an extremely hard decision to make these days with the state of things - we moved during the Biden years and never expected this to happen. But for you, Seattle is 100% blue, very progressive, and a wonderful city.

Also, living in a state with no state income tax is an absolutely massive game changer. You will be shook the first paycheck you get and realize all of the take-home pay you have access to.

In terms of healthcare, tech health insurance is usually excellent. I have it and it is extremely reasonable - I pay $70/mo, and have excellent care.

I've gotten multiple diagnoses here that I couldn't get back home, including endometriosis. I've had surgery with a top surgery in Austin and it cost me less than $3k, considering your salary you would be extremely comfortable and I wouldn't say healthcare would be an issue - you have a guaranteed job, and if you lose that job, you move back home.

It's hard to move to a new city, new country, leave all your friends and family behind. But my husband and I have seen amazing progress in both of our careers, more money, more work-life balance, we could finally buy a house, have made great friends, etc.

Insurance will be part of your employment, but if the pay is so good I would assume their health plan is great. 




Seattle doesn't have income tax, so you'll have even more savings there. 




Lack of public transport may be one drawback, but owning a car is most likely cheaper than here. 




Rent is going to be similar in terms of absolute numbers and your income is going up, so no biggie.

- you pay for what you get (and as my husband puts it, control where it’s going)
- We are in good health and not on any chronic medications so we chose high-deductible plan as you get to open a Health Savings Plan (triple tax free like a super TFSA)
- I am giving birth this year to our second child so we will hit our 5k deductible (which is also our 5k out of pocket max after which insurance covers everything; preventative and routine care is covered already)
- experience with doctors/dentists has been top notch for us, no long waits nor is it impossible to find a family doctor/pediatrician like in Vancouver 


Credit
- open a US credit card to build up history asap. My husband finally got his score after 6 months. He did a lot of legwork where we opened several cards, have a car loan, opened a small secured loan, report our rent, etc
- calling Experian to get your identity verified is a freaking nightmare, there’s a hack on Reddit where you hit 2 to call their business customer service and you can talk to an actual person, but it will still be an endless dead end loop

Insurance 
- we got a discount because my parents listed us on their car insurance before we moved
- you will need to change insurance every 6 months, it’s silly but even with no tickets/accidents…they raised our rates (it’s a thing in US)
- super easy to switch online and we found a cheaper rate

Tax
- we hired a US accountant and Canadian accountant (two individuals who we have work as a team) as the year we moved we need to file in both countries and it’s tricky. Paid ~5k total
- we paid tax and moved out our TFSA as that gets taxed by IRS
- RRSPs are not taxed in Washington state
- we own a place in Vancouver, which my SIL serves as the Canadian tax guarantor so we don’t have to pay non-resident tax on the rental


We have flown a few times to/from Asia and Europe and have had no issues with immigration except for going into secondary for the first time in March for my 2 year old son (his certificate of US citizenship is still in process, but it was still super quick as we were given priority).

We drive up to Vancouver at 1x a month, and never had any issues.

Yes, the govt is currently crazy and lots of things are unpredictable, but the people on the ground are still friendly. I have had people apologize to me for Trump when they hear we recently moved from Canada!

I forget when we are back in Vancouver to not smile and say hi to strangers you walk by. Yes we have dumb and awful Americans, but most people will not be like that.

Anyhow, I love both countries, but the higher salary and take-home (not to mention future opportunities) was a no-brainer for our family in particular.

1) Is this a contract or permanent move?

4) transfer some of your salary, maybe $9k CDN, every month to a Canadian account, and after a year, you can invest it but always keep a year's worth in cash so you have Canadian funds in a Canadian account in case you have to leave.

5) Scrub all your electronics. Don't advertise that your Canadian. Be on guard in mixed company. 

Bonus: If you really want to support Canada while working and living in the US, make monthly trips to Canada (that's where NEXUS will help) and stock up on Canadian stuff, pay the duty, and spend your money back home.

I'll assume you're aware of the cultural differences, especially right now and have decided that will work for you.



The biggest irritant was healthcare. Dealing with insurance companies and hospitals and multiple Billings etc was super painful and very expensive. If you have family members with complex medical history I would reconsider.


If your partner is planning on getting pregnant, I would seriously consider which state you will be in. If her life is threatened, can she receive medical care at the detriment to the fetus?


They take citizenship weirdly seriously down there. So expect to be treated as an outsider by a ton of businesses. Even getting a fishing license was difficult with a visa. 


Quality of food was very different. I found we needed to buy organic everything not just because it was organic but because it contained less sugar and preservatives. 


Taxes - get a tax consultation before you go. Understand if you will be a deemed resident, factual resident or non factual resident. Understand if you will be in a position of deemed disposition, and what that entails. Find a CPA who deals in cross border taxes because you will be filing with both agencies and some things will get double taxes.


Finally - understand you will have much fewer worker protections and that turnover can be higher. So avoid lifestyle inflation, save 60-70% of that take-home salary and dump it into an nice S&P 500 ETF and some in Bonds


If the job ends sooner than you would have expected, that will be your cushion.

I love Toronto but the salary differences are too much to move back. Yes, money isn’t everything. But retiring early is a goal of mine. I don’t want to work forever to pay 50% in taxes.

One thing I can tell you is don’t buy into the fear mongering they try to sell us about the USA.

Health Insurance is not bad at all, currently it costs me $65 biweekly. Everything is covered with a very small copay at a visit. This is WAY cheaper than paying 40-50% taxes the government in Canada charges for free healthcare. Obviously depends who you work for but chances are if they are paying you almost 300k they have solid heath insurance.

Car insurance is cheaper than Toronto. When every small neighbourhood street isn’t getting cars stolen out of their driveways, it does wonders to car insurance rates.

Crime really depends on where you live, compared to Toronto I do live in a much safer area. I could leave my garage open all day and nothing would happen. 

Food is a lot cheaper to go out and eat. But groceries is the big difference, there are grocery options for all income levels you can go to Aldi for cheap options and Wholefoods for premium. In Canada everything costs a lot in every grocery store.

There is a small fear of Mass shootings especially when you hear about it on the news. I can’t lie it does suck to have to worry about that, but in a country of 330 million people, you are good. You can also significantly reduce those chances depending on the states and neighbourhoods you live in.

Here’s a real life and very current example of our health care system - my dad (83) has been in the ICU on life support twice (2 weeks on life support in ICU, and 7 weeks total in hospital), has had dozens of EKGs, echo cardiograms, CTs, blood tests etc, has undergone a hospital transfer twice, had pacemaker surgery, an angiogram and stent surgery, and valve replacement…all between January 3 and today. 

He was high priority due to the life threatening nature of his situation, and his advanced age didn’t affect the timeliness or quality of his care in any way whatsoever. Nor should it. He is not a high income person, but he worked all his life as an educator and paid his fair share into the system. Now he’s been a pensioner for a couple of decades and when it was his turn to draw down, he was able to do so (and it saved his life).

Your family owning several businesses doesn’t mean shit anyways, in fact it’s probably a stronger reason for you to stay in Canada (beyond obvious nepotism and having a silver spoon your whole life, so you don’t understand what it’s like for a 2nd or 3rd generation immigrant to go through uni debt to get a coveted degree and get a 2x pay raise in the states).

Either way, Canadian wages are stagnant and while you’re free to virtue signal all you want and stunt your career development - it’s not a popular opinion. Speaking from personal experience as a engineering graduate from UofT, the end goal of UofT, UW, UBC, etc is always the states. UW is the top engineering school in the country BECAUSE it guarantees placements in the Bay Area.

I don't disagree with your statement about Canada's reliance on housing. Our economy has real problems. But there's a reason the US companies pay more, they don't play by the rules. A tax haven only works if it can siphon talent and resources from other areas. You are essentially the resource being siphoned.

If you were living in Poland in 1933, and you got an offer from a company in Nazi Germany making high end planes for the Luftwaffe that paid double what you were currently making, in hindsight would you take that job? 

You talk about prioritizing career, while completely ignoring prioritizing autonomy, freedoms, the right to vote etc.. they are all part of the same system. Making a lot of money means nothing if youre living in a country like the US is currently heading towards. 

No country on earth pays comparable wages to the US. But yet somehow a lot of those countries are way ahead of the US in terms of QoL, happiness, life expectancy etc.

The problem is that Meta doesn’t run an affiliate/rev share system *and* will open links in an internal browser container on mobile (while also profiting off tracking cookies on desktop). This means the Star sees markedly reduced ad revenue from the engagement, decreased traffic flow to the rest of the site, and loses out on aggregate data harvesting - both as an analytics source and for selling anonymized metrics as a rev source. All while Meta in turn profits from that data and user “lock in.” That means more articles have to be paywalled in an attempt to drive revenue - and we all know people are allergic to paying $5 a month for journalism.

Why should Meta directly profit from the Star’s content (via data harvesting, reducing churn, keeping users in-ecosystem longer, getting more views on in-feed ads placed between the articles etc.) without compensating the content creator(s) making it possible?
