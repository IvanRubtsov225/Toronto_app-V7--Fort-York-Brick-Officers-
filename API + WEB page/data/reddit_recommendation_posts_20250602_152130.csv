1l179aw,FoodToronto,Bar Clams,"Saturday evening at Bar Clams. Was looking forward to some authentic East coast food and it did not disappoint. 

Started with a glass of champers and a tequila sunrise. Cocktails made with fresh squeezed juice a la minute- out of this world. 

Molasses bread with salted butter and a side of Chow Chow. Bread perfectly warm with an excellent crumb. Just right to start. 

Iceberg salad was lovely thanks to the heap of fresh herbs and a slightly sweet dressing. 

Service was good, not great. A bit slow and not super attentive. The server in training was very lovely and welcoming and positive. That bartender was working his butt off serving the entire room but was completely dialled in. He loves his job. 

Next were scallops and bacon in maple butter. Delicious but very rich. 

White asparagus with Parmesan was a miss. Beautiful on the plate but disappointing on the palate. The sauce was overly salted but the asparagus needed something to help it out. I’d pass next time. 

Hot turkey sandwich had pillowy white bread with just enough perfectly seasoned, juicy turkey nestled between. We apparently got the “last one” that day, which was a bit odd at 6:30. But I’m glad we did. The gravy was satisfyingly hot, and the peas fresh and crisp. 

The final bites were lemon meringue pie. Meringue fired just before serving gave it a nice nutty caramel toast. The lemon curd sublime. Highly recommend. 

The room is nicely appointed with a communal serpentine diner counter, and high top seating on the perimeter. The backless stools were comfortable enough to urge you on after 90 minutes. Gratuitous use of glass block lets lots of light and neighborhood character sine through. Dining room was very clean with obvious care taken to the bar display to prevent dust bunnies. Logos on all the plates meant you’ll never forget where you are. 

Overall a great meal in a nice space. Definitely worth a repeat visit to try the fish and chips (large portion size) and a nice selection of oysters on offer. ",26,49,2025-06-01 22:53:12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l179aw,perkzcentral,0.61,True
1l1qw62,FoodToronto,Halal Tasting Menus?,"Hi everyone, I've only seen one post on this sub asking for halal fine dining and its a few years old so I wanted to make another one.

We dont normally do fine dining so I wanted to go for some sort of tasting menu where we can try a few dishes as opposed to one or two, but trying to google halal options is difficult as instead of bringing up tasting menu's that allow halal substitutions or pescatarian it just brings up shwarma lol

The subreddit as well provides clubs, as well as pop up events, so seeing this is also quite interesting. I know for some it's a massive commute if you are in the Toronto area, but I think there is something for everyone if they put the work in.

I think for some, it could be familiarity with people to Come by when it comes to events in general. I think maybe diversify yourself through your interest would be more ideal. 

Anyways, I sometimes host or have events In general of my own that I have, so if anyone wants to come by, message me anytime. If there's events that you would recommend, post it down below as well.

1kg9cho,askTO,Was I wrong to wait for someone else to run onto the bus?,"This morning I got on one of the ttc busses and as I was getting on I saw a girl running to the stop (she was about 5 metres away) so I lowkey stepped into the entrance, checked my presto balance for like 2 seconds then continued, just so the girl had enough time to get on. After I did that, the bus driver screams at me and told me that next time he will leave me on the side of the road and that he knows where I’m going (idk how he knows). The bus was actually running a couple minutes early so i didn’t really think much about the extra 5 seconds I might’ve wasted.

Next stop someone else was running to the bus too and just about made it in front of the doors but he shut them on her and took off. 

I understand ttc drivers have a schedule to follow and deal with a lot but I feel as though he didn’t have to threaten me and I’m not sure what he means by saying he knows where I’m going (I’m a girl so this is kinda creepy if he does know). 

I thought it’d be a somewhat nice thing to do bc I get the stress of missing a bus but maybe it was stupid of me bc I guess most people should plan ahead of time? I’m not sure but idk if it was ok to be yelled at like that.

1l0naup,toronto,2025 community mid-year check-in,"For the last few years we've done a community moderation update to start/end off the calendar year. The mod-team thought it would be a good idea to do a mid-year check-in too so here we go.

# Softened rules and enforcement  

We've made small rules adjustments, or tweaked how we're enforcing rules. This includes allowing more picture posts, letting downvotes take care of what the community does and doesn't want to see. We've also allowed Toronto related questions here a lot more, rather than diverting them all to r/askTO. Seems like these changes have been going alright so far. Still some minor adjustments for the community and mods to get used to but all-in-all no big problems noticed.

We've also been adjusting our enforcement on headline rules. Officially the rule still says no editorialized headlines but enforcement wise, we've been a little more lax when headlines are adjusted to remove clickbait in them. for example if the headline is ""you won't believe which bar got raided by the cops last night!"" we probably wouldn't mind if you changed it to include the name of whichever bar it was. But if you're changing it in other ways, that might inject opinion for example, then we'd probably ask you to fix that. So to summarize, while editorializing headlines is generally still against the rules, we may provide exceptions if you are simply making it not clickbait.

# AMAs 

We're still working to bring you more of these. They've gone well so far. We had a huge one with Mayor Olivia Chow in January, which went well. We did have significant issues with brigading there, which was a bit of work for the mod team to deal with but we have some adjustments in mind that will make it smoother in the future, so good learnings all-in-all. That was definitely our biggest AMA to date. If you know of anybody who might make for a good AMA here, or of you want to volunteer to help coordinate some for us, send over a [modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftoronto&subject=&message=). We could always use more volunteers!

# Increased transparency 

We're trying to make sure to more consistently leave comments when a thread is locked or removed to explain (even if briefly) why that action was taken, to help you understand what is going on, since last time we talked we heard some frustrations about how it felt arbitrary. This feels like a positive change so far so we'll keep doing it but if there is a thread where we miss that, please feel free to let us know so we can remedy it.

# Ongoing moderation concerns

The mod team is still dealing with a very significant amount of racism in the community. While we frequently encounter bigotry of all types, there has been a particular uptick in racism worth noting here including targeting South Asians and other communities. We have a low tolerance here for incivility in general, but any instances of hate or bigotry will be dealt with harshly. If you see posts or comment of concern against any group in this regard, please report them so we can more swiftly take action. Users that incite violence or promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned. There will not be debate or additional warnings - You all agreed to these rules when you created your reddit account.
