1kx41yc,toronto,My first time visiting!!!,"Hi all! Can I just say, this city is WONDERFUL!!! My husband has wanted me to visit Toronto since we met, since he grew up here. For context, I‚Äôm American and he is dual Canadian/American citizen, and his family moved when he was a teen. He misses it so much, I wish we could move here but it‚Äôs so expensive üò≠ But as an American, here are the things I‚Äôve noticed:

1) You all are so nice! Thank you for being so welcoming, it has made this trip wonderful! 

2) This city is SO CLEAN! Oh my gosh how do you do it!?

3) Bulk Barn is now my favorite store ever. I told my husband we will come up strictly for this ü§£

4) There is so much to do, I feel like I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface, and I need to come back to experience this city more! 

5) I LOVE the amazing cultures around here! Thank you for celebrating cultures and not covering them up 

6) I have (surprisingly) spoken so much German here, it‚Äôs made my week! 

7) The food is so good üòã

8) Do the subways ever close? Seeing them open after midnight was so surprising to me 

9) I love the public transportation! It makes it so much fun to get around üòä 

10) Most importantly, it feels pretty safe here. Naturally there is crime everywhere, but honestly it feels like most people here care about the wellbeing of others which is amazing and such a breath of fresh air from the US. 

Keep it up Toronto! I wish we could afford to live here. My husband misses it so much, there are small differences that are wonderful. Maybe one day, but until then we plan on visiting (and of course buying only Canadian and hopefully helping anyway we can!) as much as possible ‚ò∫Ô∏è",406,58,2025-05-27 20:58:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1kx41yc/my_first_time_visiting/,"['m American and he', 'Bulk', 'This city', 'this city', 'Naturally there', 'The food', 'Bulk Barn', 'My husband', 'I love the', 'There']",0.34689599679834054,False,0.94

1krypa7,toronto,I LOVE Toronto,"I moved to Toronto about a year ago from London, UK. My partner is from Madrid, and most of our friends are from major cities across Europe, and we have lived all over the world, including the USA. The general consensus is the same, Toronto is a bit colder than we like(especially as I write this), but aside from that, it's INCREDIBLE! 

While it doesn't carry the clout and relevance that NYC or London do, it is a world-class city in every right, and Torontonians need to start taking more pride in that! It has literally everything: beaches, islands, ravines, a stunning skyline, art galleries, international enclaves, breweries, nice people, markets, diverse nightlife opportunities, vintage shopping, great festivals, family-friendly events, and endless live music gigs. It's the perfect blend of American and European lifestyle! 

Don't even get me started on the food scene here! Have you all been keeping Toronto's food scene a secret all this time? 

I could go on and on.

1kxthjx,askTO,Why doesn‚Äôt the City have 24/7 roadwork crews during construction season?,"Every time I drive around Toronto during construction season, I see blocked off lanes and half-completed work zones ‚Äî but no one is actually working. Day after day, the same lanes are closed, yet there‚Äôs no activity during evenings, overnights, or even weekends in many cases.

This city is gridlocked for months at a time, and it inconveniences thousands of people daily. With the volume of commuters, deliveries, emergency services, and public transit impacted ‚Äî why aren‚Äôt we working around the clock to get this stuff done faster?

I know the city recently made allowances for certain extended construction hours, which is a start ‚Äî but why not go all the way to 24/7 work, especially on major infrastructure like highways? (ie. Gardiner) Most of that work doesn‚Äôt generate disruptive sound pollution for nearby residential areas anyway, so what‚Äôs the holdup?

Instead of these projects dragging on for 2‚Äì3 years, we could realistically cut timelines in half (or less) with around-the-clock shifts. There are also plenty of labourers and tradespeople currently looking for steady work. Wouldn‚Äôt this be a win-win?

Is the issue budget? Union contracts? Genuinely curious what‚Äôs stopping this from happening. Or do they just want us to suffer?

If anyone works in the industry or has insight, I‚Äôd love to understand the reasoning?",19,27,2025-05-28 17:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1kxthjx/why_doesnt_the_city_have_247_roadwork_crews/,"['If anyone works in the industry or', 'This city', 'but no one', 'Is the', 'which']",0.11015406162464984,False,0.77
1kxqxxd,askTO,Weekend in Toronto,"Hi everyone, 

My 93 year old grandfather is a big MLB fan, and has had a dream for a long time of visiting every park in the league. So as a birthday, my mother and I are surprising him with a trip to Toronto to see the Blue Jays play the White Sox, his favorite team and to check Rogers Centre off his list. (No idea why he picked that team to be a fan of but that's his cross to bear lol)

I created a basic itinerary more or less, with the typical stuff like the CN tower observation deck, ROM, St Lawrence Market, Harbourfront+a boat ride etc, but I want to try out and bring him around to more cool spots in the city that aren't as egregiously touristic in nature. Does anyone have any ideas of cool spots or restaurants that aren't as tourist trappy type? My family coming along loves food so there are no restrictions of any kind, whether it be the typical American/Canadian fare like burgers and what not or more ethnic places. We're from Chicago so we are well versed in city restaurants and the diversity they include. Potentially any type of Indian or Filipino, or any ethnicity/restaurant that is common in the GTA but not in Chicago? (That's a hard ask I know, two cities with large immigrant backgrounds) We're already gonna hit Timmy's to check out the hype and see if it's better than Dunkin lol

The only issue is that his knees have given out and in the past few years he's developed a few mobility issues, so we'll probably be bringing a little wheelchair to use here and there. Accessible places would be nice but are not 100% necessary, it's not like he can't walk at all and he still has some pep in his step. We're staying at some hotel right nearby Scotiabank but my mother might be renting a car (tbd) so ideas for any cool spot worth a trek in the GTA would be nice.

I was able to get away without being physically harmed and I called local authorities and spoke with them afterwards. However, as of now, there doesn‚Äôt seem to have been any follow-up. What's even more disturbing is that the same person re-listed my laptop on Marketplace right after it happened.

I‚Äôm wondering has anyone here dealt with something similar, and is there anything else I can do to push for further action or recover the item? I‚Äôve learned that meeting in a police station parking lot is best, but I wish I had known earlier.

Yet if you just went by what the news reported, you‚Äôd never realize how untrustworthy this campaign is.

Almost every article that mentions the AI-generated videos or casually notes that Summerhill Market is behind the petition just shrugs, then jumps straight to quoting ‚Äúlegitimate concerns‚Äù about losing curb-side parking.

Outlets from NOW Toronto to the Star to blogTO and Toronto Life give a quick ‚Äúoops, they did that‚Äù nod to the fake avatars, then pivot right back to the tired ‚Äúlocal businesses vs. transit riders‚Äù framing, never stopping to go, ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶guys, wtf?‚Äù

Meanwhile, the folks behind this petition have gone out of their way to hide their involvement.

May 17 @ Queen & Broadview, 7:00 p.m. start","Come drink, eat, and hang out with fellow Toronto Redditors looking to make friends and connect on Saturday, May 17, at the Toronto Reddit May meetup - The Long Weekend May 2-4 Edition! It's free to attend and there is no official RSVP, however our reservation requires each person to order something, even if it's just a glass of soda.

We're changing our venue this time to [Duke's Refresher Riverside](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/) at 709 Queen Street East (Queen and Broadview), as our regular venue The Artful Dodger closes their upstairs area over the summer.

If you've never been to a Reddit meetup, everyone is very welcoming and conversations always extend beyond the Reddit platform itself, with no questions about your username. If you are returning, you'll likely recognize some faces, but there are always new folx to meet.

**FAQ:**

* **How do I find the group?:**¬†We'll be on the second level of Duke's Refresher.
* **Am I welcome?:**¬†Everyone is welcome, from visitors to newcomers to people looking to make new friends.
* **Will people my age be there?:**¬†Based on my experiences over the years, the average age of attendees is 20-40.
* **Will women be there?:**¬†Yes! I'm a woman, so you won't be the only woman there.
* **Will I make new friends/connections?:**¬†Everyone who attends is looking for a different experience, but the commonality is getting out, meeting new people and having a good time. I have been attending since 2018 & hosting since 2022. I've made friends I've traveled with and attended some weddings and I still keep in touch with a few out-of-towners. You can make these connections from attending a single (1) meetup (I've seen it happen a lot), so if you're thinking it will be a waste of time to come just once, it's not - anything is possible.
* **How often do you have these events?:**¬†I aim to host one event a month. These have typically been Saturdays starting between 7-8 p.m. I aim to post my events with reasonable notice, including reminders.
* **Does it cost money to attend?:**¬†Though there is no cost to attend the event itself, we ask that you purchase a drink and/or food to support the venue, as they have to turn away other paying customers to fill our reservation. If you do not wish to eat or drink anything, you could tip $5-10 to the staff as a courtesy.
* **What are the food/drink options like?:**¬†There are vegetarian, vegan and non-alcoholic options available, and they are allergy-friendly.¬†[Menu link](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/)
* **Is the venue accessible?**¬†Unfortunately, the venue has stairs and is not fully accessible.

If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment publicly or message me privately. I keep an eye on my account leading up to and during the event, and though I try to respond to messages as soon as possible, I may not be able to reply right away during the event.

Everyone is welcome and there is no RSVP, but attendees are required to make a purchase at the venue as part of our reservation's conditions.

Anyways, my name is Trae, I run these events called Block Party in Montreal and Toronto based on the mentality of throwing house parties at club attendance and amenities. Moving here for university, I found the nightlife scene wasn't the same as my hometown, Toronto seems to be very business oriented versus creating the most enjoyable event for people and I'd like to change that (with my minimal budget and a lot of friends from university). I'm throwing an event called NO FLYERS on the 31st and hopefully people here enjoy the concept of a Toronto event where we're all enjoying ourselves at the same price point, with good music and vibes.

There are some awesome shows and festivals coming up in Toronto this summer, and this busy season always brings about more scammers.

As you know, scammers take advantage of the anonymous nature of Reddit. They can use compromised accounts, farm karma, and impersonate others. Ultimately this enables them to ‚Äúlook‚Äù trustworthy, commit fraud, and block you. They can keep doing this with little risk of being stopped or face consequences.

This is exactly what Verified Messaging in goConfirm is designed to stop.¬†

Now once you‚Äôve connected with a potential buyer or seller in goConfirm, you can now use built-in Verified Messaging so you know exactly who you are talking with when exchanging important and sensitive info like payment details or meet-up/shipping logistics.

In the very rare event of fraud, our Fraud Support team has your back. We can take action, because we know exactly who‚Äôs involved ‚Äîincluding permanent bans.

It‚Äôs easy: Like before, create and connect to invite codes for whatever you‚Äôre buying or selling. You can share the code in your posts or DMs and ask interested parties to connect.

It‚Äôs not just for Reddit, you can use goConfirm in Facebook Groups, Marketplace and WhatsApp.¬†

1kxqiav,TorontoRealEstate,Is $1.16M too much for a freehold townhouse in Patterson? Need advice before firming up offer.,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some honest advice here. My wife and I currently have a conditional offer accepted on a freehold townhouse in Patterson (Vaughan) for $1.16 million. We have 2 more days before it becomes firm, and we‚Äôre trying to decide if we should proceed or walk away.

About the property:
	‚Ä¢	Built in 2009
	‚Ä¢	Approx. 1,800 sq ft above grade
	‚Ä¢	Finished basement
	‚Ä¢	Lot and layout are decent
	‚Ä¢	Move-in ready condition (not a total reno project)

Why I‚Äôm having second thoughts:
	‚Ä¢	I saw a semi in the same neighborhood with much older interior and unfinished basement sell recently for $1.04 million. Definitely needed work, but it makes me question the $1.16M we‚Äôre about to commit to.
	‚Ä¢	The price feels a bit high for our budget‚Äîwe‚Äôre not trying to flip or be greedy, but we want to make sure we‚Äôre not overpaying, especially with everything else we need to spend on (new parent here)

Other considerations:
	‚Ä¢	We do love the area, schools are good, and proximity to family matters a lot.
	‚Ä¢	But we‚Äôre worried if prices continue to soften or interest rates stay high, we could‚Äôve gotten something similar for less if we waited.

Any input from those familiar with Patterson or recent homebuyers/sellers in Vaughan would be appreciated.
Are we being overly cautious? Or does this sound like a fair (but top-end) deal in today‚Äôs market?",1,25,2025-05-28 15:44:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1kxqiav/is_116m_too_much_for_a_freehold_townhouse_in/,['but it'],0.17838035527690702,True,0.54
1kwssxt,TorontoRealEstate,Buy a condo now or wait to buy a house later?,"Hi everyone, I'm a 27F currently saving for my first home. By the end of this year, I'll have around $200K saved up for a down payment.

I'm facing a bit of a dilemma and would love some advice. I recently got out of a long term relationship and I'm eager to create more stability in my living situation. I'm debating between:

1. Buying a condo in the next year

or

2. Continuing to rent for a few more years, in hopes of eventually buying a house with a future partner.

There are houses under $1M outside of the GTA that I could technically afford on my own, but l'd feel scared to live in a house alone. As a solo female, I would feel more safe to live in a condo with security.

On the other hand, I know condo investments typically need around 10 years to be worth it, and l'd be okay living in one that long, but I'm worried that in 10 years, detached house prices might be even more out of reach.

My long-term goal is to eventually live in a detached house, as I don't see myself staying in a condo forever. But I'm not sure if buying a condo now would make that goal harder to reach down the line.

A bit more context:

* ÔªøÔªøI've contributed 60k to my RRSP to take advantage of the Home Buyers' Plan
* ÔªøÔªøI started contributing to my FHSA this year
* ÔªøÔªøThis would be my first-ever property purchase

Would you prioritize getting into the market now with a condo, or keep renting and aim for a house later, possibly with a partner?

Thanks in advance for any insights!",25,70,2025-05-27 13:10:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1kwssxt/buy_a_condo_now_or_wait_to_buy_a_house_later/,"['My long-term goal', 'I could technically afford']",0.13400920974450387,False,0.82

1b7dt3q,TorontoJobs,"Rules Update: Job Postings, Disclosure of Pay, Appropriate Netiquette, Removal of Ragebait","**Ragebait** - This is a job board, not a workplace demographics report. This **isn't** the place to complain about immigrants, newcomers, student visas, (insert ethnicity) people...etc. Complaining won't help you get a job nor will it change the employer's mind. Ragebait posts and comments will be removed and/or banned depending on each moderator's discretion. Posts **without** [Hiring] or [For Hire] tags will be under greater scrutiny and increased risk of removal. Examples:

* Why are there so many (insert ethnicity) working in (insert profession)?
* Immigrant this, newcomer that, student visa this...
* ""Lol. I'm guessing the mods in this sub are refugees."" [\[1\]](https://old.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1b7dt3q/rules_update_job_postings_disclosure_of_pay/kthz451/) Comments like won't improve one's chances of finding employment. It doesn't make any meaningful contribution to the community.

**Minimum Wage** - Job Postings that do not pay at least $16.55/h will be removed and/or banned unless exempt under Ontario Law. Posts offering to work below minimum wage will also be removed.

https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1002886/ontario-increasing-minimum-wage-to-1655-an-hour

**Disclosure of Pay Rate or Range** - Job Postings that do not explicitly list pay rate/range will be at risk of removal. It is not written in law... yet. But we're not going to wait. Hiding and not disclosing the pay rate/range is a terrible practice and wastes everyone's time.

* https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pay-transparency-1.7027826
* Up to each moderator's discretion: If a posting doesn't explicitly list the pay rate/range but does list it in the link, the post is at risk of being removed.
* Example: This posting would be at risk of removal https://old.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/13ft2ct/hiring_city_of_toronto_byelection_workers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

**Netiquette** - Common Toronto. We can do better. Be nice. Be empathetic. Pretend your grandma human resources is watching. Unprofessional comments will be at risk of removal or ban to each moderator's own discretion. We've so far been very lenient and hands-off on some not-so-nice comments. Don't Do Examples:

* ""Shut up. If you have no suggestion keep your stupid distate to yourself."" [\[1\]](https://old.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/17jkshe/21f_looking_for_a_job/k73z914/)

1kxmn63,TorontoJobs,I am so disappointed in the job market,"Why I am not enough? I have spent 7 grueling years studying to obtain my bachelors and masters degree in architecture. On top of that, I have interned at multiple offices - gaining nearly two years of experience. I have consistently sent out hundreds and hundreds of applications over the course of a year and a half and have been met with nothing but rejection from companies, with the exception of being offered an unpaid work opportunity or laughably low pay (>or= minimum wage) which I will not accept. No one told me in school finding a job will be so damn hard, no one told me making money as an adult is almost like a game of luck. Are some just not meant to survive in this economy but are expected to just lay down and rot? The same thing can be said about finding a life partner - the stars have to align for you, but I don't want to get into that here. I am disheartened because my friends have stable and good paying careers (they have breezed past the six figure mark and their paycheque is growing with promotions) and I can't seem to kickstart my career.

I am doing a BBA in Accounting at Sheridan College (and before you judge me for choosing a college for my degree, knowing the ""diploma mill""  reputation they now have, it was the only program OSAP would fully cover). My plan was to complete a year, find a full-time job in the meantime, and then transfer to an actual university. That way, I could cover any costs that OSAP didn't. 

It is now almost June, and I am still jobless. I am so demotivated that I have completely lost interest in Accounting, especially after realizing how dead the market is right now. I am a week away from turning 30, and learning new things just isn't as easy as it used to be. I have been dropping out of classes, and I just received a message from OSAP asking for my progress report in order to recieve funding for September. I will most likely be on OSAP restriction. 

I am genuinely not sure what the point of this post is. I am just tired. I wish I went back to school a lot sooner and established my career when I was younger. I feel like such a failure.

This is by far the most absurd thing i‚Äôve seen so far because maybe not in everyone‚Äôs experience but in mine I was barely a student, for 8 months I did the job of an employee if not more as I was doing a mix of administrative work and front line work but this doesn‚Äôt count because of what?! 

Minimum wage with 2-3 years of experience???
 
Like genuinely what? I understand that the job market isn‚Äôt great in Toronto but people who‚Äôve been in the field having to work for minimum wage and then new grads aren‚Äôt even really considered in this case completely scraps the concept of entry level jobs 

Performing the role for a qualification I didn‚Äôt have??? 

Obviously as a new grad I haven‚Äôt considered  myself a ‚Äòpractitioner‚Äô on my resume because I hadn‚Äôt finished my degree but then being told by employers I can‚Äôt be considered for a job because I haven‚Äôt performed the role under my title that I spent the last 4 years learning about and applying it in other settings which is indicated on my resume but not being considered as it wasn‚Äôt my exact title‚Ä¶not realistic in the human services as organizations love to come up with elaborate names for the same role

The interview took place at a bar, and the man who interviewed me talked for nearly four hours. A lot of it was just him monologuing about the fashion industry, but what really made me uncomfortable were some of the things he asked and said. He wanted to know if I‚Äôd be comfortable wearing ‚Äúgaudy‚Äù clothing both on and off camera, and then he started asking invasive personal questions like my bust size, if I shave my pubic hair in a certain way, and made multiple comments about how women‚Äôs bodies are sexy and youthful from a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù perspective.

1kw9420,TorontoJobs,Method to get interviews,"Seeing a lot of posts from people having a hard time with the job market and want to share a method I use to get interviews. Works about 25% of the time, though I am not applying to many job ads.

TLDR: Apply to the position through the website so your application is in the applicant tracking system. Then, send an email to the hiring manager to try and get your foot in the door. You could call this a ""cold networking approach."" Here's how it works in more detail:

**1. Apply as regular.** It's unlikely that just putting in an application will ever, even in the best of times, get you an interview except by sheer luck or if you're in a particular industry that favours job seekers.

**2. Look up the hiring manager.** Many job ads list the name of the position that the role will report to, and if not it is something you can often look up on the organization's website. LinkedIn can also be helpful to find the right person, or even a Google search can sometimes find them.

**3. Find their email address.** I find the best way is to do a Google search for ""company name"" and ""email prefix."" In most organizations, it will be something like firstname.lastname at companyname dot com, or firstinitial.last name or just firstname. You will sometimes end up sending a couple of initial emails until you get it right.

**4. Send them the following email:** Hi Name. I applied for a role as nameofrole, which I understand reports directly to you. If it is appropriate, I would love to connect for a quick 10-minute call to learn a little more about this opportunity. I believe I would be a good fit, but have a few questions. Thanks, Yourname.

**5. Attach your cover letter and resume** as a single PDF to the email. They may not open the PDF, as most organizations have trained everyone to never do that, so be sure to also have your email signature link to your LinkedIn or some other platform that they will know and trust.

**6. Assume that they will not respond.** Most hiring managers will open and read your email, but only a small percentage will respond to the initial email. You should plan to send the following email 48 hours later: Hi Name. Just a quick follow-up to my previous email. I'd love to connect if you have a moment. Best, Yourname.

**7. When you get a reply, they will say one of the following:** a) Yes, let's connect for a call. b) No, it isn't appropriate in our process for us to have a call right now. c) Some variation of, How dare you and how did you find my email!  You wouldn't have wanted to work for c), so consider that a bullet dodged. But for a) and b), you have your foot in the door. With a), you can prepare for a very quick call, during which you can ask some questions about the role, and especially to try and learn any pain points for the hiring manager, so you can be ready to share how you will solve those pains when/if you get the formal interview. With b), even though you don't get the call, you've managed to connect directly with the hiring manager and increase your chances of an interview. Overall, for both a) and b), you've demonstrated that you are proactive, a good communicator, and ready to make the hiring manager's job easier.

Once you get the interview, there's obviously a lot more to think about and prepare. I try to interview every few months, even though I'm not really interested in changing jobs, because it's important to keep the skills sharp, and also because it's good for confidence. And finally, better than the above method is a ""warm networking approach,"" in which you would have cultivated the connection with the hiring manager over a period of time and targeted precisely the job and organization you want.

It can be difficult, but keeping a positive mindset and remembering that you are bringing value to any potential employer can make a big difference in these interactions. I wish you all good luck in your job search.",147,30,2025-05-26 19:45:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1kw9420/method_to_get_interviews/,"['I find the best way', 'and if not it', 'better than the above method', 'just putting', 'If it']",0.21294483702571934,False,0.95

1ki58la,TorontoJobs,Job Market is BROKEN,"I have been looking for senior PM/BA roles since last fall. I applied to over 200 jobs and went through a few interviews. I did get lucky and landed a decent role recently. My experience and skillset against this role was quite a good fit, but I have concluded that 99% reason why I landed this role was luck. The current employment landscape in Canada is extremely challenging and here is my observsion and journey. By all means this post is NOT a success story to brag about, but a society problem that needs immediate attention. 

Throughout my unemployment journey, I have had the good opportunity to meet a few recruiters and HR friends. They all shared similar feedback on how our jobs system is broken to the core, and quite frankly have no idea how to fix it. As an applicant, I shared my frastration and anxiety. While it has been acknowledged, we agreed this is more Canada‚Äôs problem and it will take years to repair, if that‚Äôs even fixable. Here are our key takeaways. 

1) The major cities job markets have slowed down since last summer. That said, reputable companies are still hiring. With the popularization of AI, companies are actually leaning more towards middle to senior management, hoping that one strong leader would replace a team. They are being extremely selective with their candidates, often requiring a perfect fit to their expected job description, culture, and personalities. High expectations comes with high price. These jobs typically have good titles, hybrid/remote, and competitive total comp - and companies are generally pretty transparent about this in their postings. But here is the problem‚Ä¶

2) I am sure most people in this community have the following experienced. As early as 2 days after a sought after job is posted, Linkedin displayed 100+ ppl have applied to this job. There you wonder what the actual eff‚Ä¶

Are there that many ppl actively looking for jobs? 
How is it possible everyone has these niche experiences? 

This is pretty demoralizing. So I asked around. 

3) after talking to a few HR friends. Here are their inputs. The reality is often more pathetic than our expectations. If you see there are 100+ ppl applied, often its closer to thousands. Easily 2000+. But thats not the comical part.  You may think ATS does the job to filter out unqualified candidates. Nope. The bad players have evolved. The old trick is to use white fonts to bypass ATS. Now they blatently lie and create perfect resumes tailored for the jobs. Of the 2000+ applicants, 90% of the resumes have almost perfect fit to the job on paper. Gone are the days when your experience is 95% match and still get an interview. That‚Äôs just not good enough anymore. Why would they pick you over a bunch of ppl when claim they have done the exact same jobs?

4) so that begs the questions. Who are these qualified/over-qualified people? To answer this question thoroughly, let‚Äôs think about your own situation. 

As an applicant legally allowed to work in Canada, when you apply for a job, your goal is obviously to start a nice career with the company that you apply to. Therefore you are honest about your experience and skillsets. You think ahead and envision yourself answering interview questions about your experience, and wish that the hiring manager like you as a person and find you a good fit. Thats the majority of us. The reason why you don‚Äôt lie or make shit up is, other than that it‚Äôs WRONG, you just never know when this will come back to haunt you. And that‚Äôs the moral line we hope to hold in the western civilization. 

4) Now imagine you are not part of the western civilization, or had a taste but on the verge of leaving due to financial reasons. There is NOTHING worse than the current situation stuck in a 3rd world country, or having your work visa expiring in a month - not even getting caught lying down the road. What are the thing that you are willing to put down in your resume to get a call from the recruiter? It‚Äôs actually a different game we are playing. We are playing to build a career, they are playing to survive another day. A call from a recruiter and interviews from hiring managers means a golden ticket out of their current situations. 

5) you may ask, don‚Äôt they need a work sponsor visa? Yes. And they absolutely check the box. Again, the objective is not about careers. Its about survival. Its about have potential opportunities and discussion to get sponsored. One in a million that they lied about everything but the hiring manager absolutely connected with the candidate. So much so that they would sponsor a work visa and forgive about the lying part. The chance of that happen is not zero and for them its a numbers game. 

6) what does this mean to you? Hiring managers have KPIs. For every fake profile they reviewed, thats one less chance yours get reviewed. Again, you are up against thousands of perfectly tailored applications. Your applications are just buried under a pile of made up candidates. Think PP in Carlton :D

Quite frankly, we need to fix this. Maybe its geofencing to only allow Canadian IP address.  We don‚Äôt think this trend is going to stop‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a borderline cybersecurity issue and it‚Äôs the everyday hardworking Canadians who are impacted the most. I do think though whoever fix this it‚Äôs going to be a multi million business because of course US and European companies are affected by job trolls‚Ä¶and this would drastically reduce HR effort and bad hires. 

Also how do I know this is valid? If you have notice the equivalent government jobs that pay decent are actually not affected. Why? Because trolls know governments do not hire ineligible workers. No exceptions.

1kcsyll,TorontoJobs,"It wasn‚Äôt fault immigration , it was exploitation by businesses and institutions.","Problem was never immigration, an international student legitimately getting a job or influx of professionals. usually a country with a higher number of highly educated skilled population has a stronger economy.

the problem was that getting a PR was already very hard (you wont believe it, but through legitimate paths, only about 10% could get a PR. So employers saw LMI.A as an opportunity to begin their slavery business by charging people who wanted to work for them $50k. and this way, a lot of fake startups started popping out (new businesses get more flexibility to bring cheap labor from another country) and their whole business has been charging people to work for them and sometimes not  actually working for them and instead, just sell them an LMI .A and tell them to go do Uber because that business does not provide any product/service.

these ridiculous LMI. A numbers mislead immigration statistics and numbers and skewed everything and lead to further increased difficulty in getting a PR (higher points required) because the government was already getting lots of immigrants from LMI.A so the required PR points adjust and adapt based on targets. and this became a vicious cycle that started going full on slavery.

Another problem that started was the number of diploma mills opening up to cash in on international student 5x tuition fees and even colleges who used to be reputable, also started going the profit focused route of accepting everyone in their program who is willing to pay a high price. the quality of education then started to drop significantly across all colleges specially during covid when professors would submit 1 week worth of lectures as a single powerpoint file and not care anymore. So this further lead to colleges becoming just a place to use for immigration and colleges gave out diplomas that do not represent actual knowledge. the lack of skill from graduates made legitimate employers avoid hiring lots of these graduates and only hire the ones with experience. and these graduates started going the LMI .A route just to save themselves after spending 5x the tuition for 2-3 years with high cost lf living.

If you agree or understand my points. we can then agree that the root cause is businesses and employers and institutions exploiting the system.

1kq3hjs,TorontoJobs,Told I got the job. Employer reposted job and got 70 people in a day. Has ghosted since.,"Yeah so things are really bad.
I had an interview through a recruiter for a position that on paper shouldn't have been very attractive to most eligible candidates. 
Anyways I needed the job and after the interview per the recruiter, the employer said I got the job and he was drafting an updated offer letter. The only mistake by me in hindsight was during the interview I pushed him to go to his upper end of the salary range and I think that really set him off.

Probably the employer thought he could find cheaper people and posted the job on LinkedIn the day after he spoke to the recruiter. Within a day it had 70 people applied to it before he too it down. This is extremely rare for civil engineering jobs and quite honestly I've seen nothing like it. Especially for this job which is bottom tier of the field at a 5 man company that really only desperate new grads would do. Ever since I havent heard back anything. It's been 5 days now and i think LinkedIn gave him the confidence that he will surely find his wage slave for half the price.

The market is well and truly cooked. Find some other means of making money everyone.

1kxuo4g,UofT,Create a Toronto safe haven for international Harvard students,"Am I hopelessly naive, or would this be totally cool?

Recent politically-motivated developments affecting international students at Harvard University spark deep concern academic freedom and about the treatment of international students.  
  
Canada has taken commendable actions in the past to assist individuals facing adversities. During one of America's darkest periods, Canada became a beacon of hope for African Americans fleeing slavery. Canada provided asylum to those resisting the Vietnam War. More recently, during the tragic events of 9/11, Canada opened its arms to air traffic passengers stranded due to US airspace shutdowns. These actions demonstrate Canada‚Äôs capacity for empathy and leadership on the global stage.

We propose the fast-tracked creation of a Harvard Toronto campus for Harvard University international students affected by current obstacles to continue their education in Toronto.¬†

1kcqus4,UofT,"It been a while, I miss her, and it was all my fault, I chickened out","About a month and a half ago, I realized I‚Äôd fallen HARD for this girl in my CSC108 class. She‚Äôs Chinese (I‚Äôm Chinese too, but CBC), and honestly, she was just‚Ä¶ different. The kind of student who never touched her phone during lecture, always did the worksheets, even sometimes answered questions, even though English clearly wasn‚Äôt her first language. She used to sit with another girl, but I think that girl dropped halfway through the term. That should‚Äôve been my freaking cue.

It‚Äôs been a MONTH since our last class. We ended early a class early. She was in a different exam section. But I swear, I think I saw her one last time, maybe sitting on the stairs in Robarts as I walked to my exam. I had 36 minutes to spare, just walking to my room‚Ä¶ and I STILL didn‚Äôt say anything. I barely glanced for half a second and froze. Classic me.

What really kills me is I had¬†*at least six solid chances*¬†to talk to her once I realized I liked her. SIX. And every time I chickened out. I kept telling myself ‚Äúnext class.‚Äù Then the final class rolls around, and she shows up 40 minutes late, looking completely dead, holding a warm bubble tea and sick. She missed the class before too. And I just watched. Like a background NPC.

I had a WHOLE SEMESTER to ask her for her WeChat. And I did nothing. Nothing. Now I‚Äôll probably never see her again. And yes, I made a post about her before on a different account, because she‚Äôs literally showing up in my dreams now. I‚Äôm going crazy. She was the most attractive, peaceful-looking girl I‚Äôve ever seen and I NEVER even talked to her. Just admired from the sidelines like a passive, awkward dumb\*\*\*.

I hate that I let this happen. I hate the constant ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù running through my head. My Apple Watch thought I was having a panic attack during that exam walk, last class, and now because of how fast my heart was racing.

1kjq8ji,UofT,"Rating and Reviewing Every Course I Took at UofT + Thoughts (CS, ‚Äò25)","Inspired by u/heatfinix, who was inspired by u/iromatsuurii.

When I first joined UofT, as well as over the years, this reddit was pretty helpful for a lot of things like course selection and general information, and I've been somewhat active at times so I guess this is my way of giving back but also summarizing my own experience for myself. Hopefully this helps someone or just serves as a fun piece of reflection. Obviously, everything here is just my opinion.

I did a CS spec, so majority of courses will be CS. I'll also rate every course out of 10, indicating how much I would recommend taking the course. This can be a bit arbitrary, so I put a general scale below:

**1-2:** Don't take this course. Everything is bad from the teaching to the assessments.

**3-4:** Course had significant teaching or assessment issues, or was just extremely boring/dry (sometimes of no fault to the instructor).

**5-6:** Content wasn't interesting to me, but I could see someone else enjoying it. Possibly minor issues with the course itself (teaching/assessments).

**7-8:** Generally good recommended course, with above average teaching and interesting content.

**9-10:** Once in a while, you experience something that changes your outlook on life, or inspires you to do something.

**Note:** My ratings don't really take into account how easy a course is, but I wrote in my reviews whether I found a particular course to be very easy/difficult. Some courses were required as well, which I will note.

# Y1 (2020-2021)

**Summary:** This was during the peak of COVID. I went to in-person class for 2 weeks, then it all got moved online. At this point I had already moved to Toronto so I ended up staying for the entire year even though classes were all virtual.

**CSC110:** Foundations of Comp Sci I
**Prof:** Mario Badr
**Crs Avg:** A-
**Me:** A

Required 1st year CS course. Basic python. Boring if you already took any CS courses in high school or fiddled with python yourself prior. Mario is great, though. 6/10

**CSC111:** Foundations of Comp Sci II
**Prof:** Mario Badr
**Crs Avg:** A-
**Me:** A

Required first year CS course. An extension of CSC110, with a larger project thrown in the mix. Still quite easy and fun overall. 7/10

**MAT137:** Calculus with Proofs
**Prof:** Alfonso Gracia-Saz
**Crs Avg:** B-
**Me:** A

Required math course for CS. I took IB Math HL in high school so I breezed through most of the beginning of the course, but the course became quite difficult towards the end. In all of undergrad, I doubt I ever put as much consistent effort for any other course. RIP Alfonso, was honestly quite a decent prof and will be missed. 7/10

**VIC172:** Physical Sciences Today
**Prof:** Hakob Barseghyan
**Crs Avg:** B+
**Me:** A-

This was part of Vic One, which is a series of first-year only seminar courses in Victoria College. I remember Hakob was great and made the lectures quite interesting, but the course was much more involved than I expected, with weekly readings taking upwards of a couple hours of dedicated time. Content was highly philosophical in nature, along with VIC173. In hindsight I might've taken something lighter on the reading. 7/10

**VIC173:** Philosophy of Science for Physical Sciences
**Prof:** Hakob Barseghyan
**Crs Avg:** B+
**Me:** A-

An extension of VIC172. 7/10

**MAT223:** Linear Algebra I
**Prof:** Forgor
**Crs Avg:** B+
**Me:** A+

This course was a caricature of the ""boring university course"" I'd heard of in high school. Boring-ass online lectures, boring-ass assignments, forced to waste my time commenting on other people's posts on Perusall (online textbook). Easy A I guess? Don't even remember who my prof. was, never saw their face. 1/10

**PSY100:** Intro Psychology
**Prof:** John Vervaeke
**Crs Avg:** B-
**Me:** A+

This course was delivered online asynchronous when I took it, but boy did it deliver regardless. John is possibly the most unintentionally funny professor ever, with his crazy hand motions and out-of-pocket examples. Content is quite interesting, and walks through the field of psychology at a high level. Definitely carried by John's delivery though, if the lecturer was boring I definitely wouldn't have a good impression of this course. 8/10

# Y2 (2021-2022)

**Summary:** Classes were mostly in-person again during this time. First year was honestly a mostly a breeze for me, so I definitely went into this year a big overconfident and didn't put as much effort in as I should've.

**CSC207:** Software Design
**Prof:** Paul Gries
**Crs Avg:** A-
**Me:** A+

Required course for CS. Was delivered totally online. They taught clean code practices such as design patterns, SOLID, etc. And accompanied it with a course project where you had to use these design principles. Boring content, boring lectures, boring assignments. This is definitely in the running for easiest course I took. Next. 2/10

**CSC236:** Introduction to the Theory of Computation
**Prof:** Danny Heap
**Crs Avg:** B
**Me:** A

Required CS course. Danny is a B-tier CS prof in my books. Teaches fine, delivery is neither boring nor interesting, relatively responsive on Piazza. Recordings were horrendous, as his annotations were indecipherable. This course was the first real ""computer science"" course. 7/10

**CSC258:** Computer Organization
**Prof:** Steve Engels
**Crs Avg:** B+
**Me:** A

Required CS course. Steve is another okay CS prof in my books. Course content was quite heavy, but this is the only real hardware course most CS students will take at UofT in my experience, so if you hate it, you'll be alright. Standard computer organization stuff: logic gates, basic physics, and assembly. IMO this course could be designed better, and a lot of the discussion of registers and memory flew over my head until I took CSC369 later. Course project was to create a game (frogger) in assembly, which I left to the end of the semester and had to do a 48 hour double all-nighter to finish. Good times. 6/10

**STA247:** Probability with Computer Applications
**Prof:** Karen Wong
**Crs Avg:** B
**Me:** A-

I think this course was later removed, and STA237 is now the standard statistics course. This course was extremely boring in almost every way possible, and felt more like a 'let's get this out of the way since it's required' kind of course. Karen definitely didn't help, but in her defense the content was so dry that I doubt anyone could make it interesting. 3/10

**CSC209:** Software Tools & Systems Programming
**Prof:** Karen Reid
**Crs Avg:** B
**Me:** A-

Required CS course. Your typical intro to C language course, covering some essential topics like basic shell scripting, sockets, and threads. I really liked this course, and Karen was a great instructor. Very responsive, and explains things really clearly. She did screw up one of our assignments, which was to create a wordle solver (assignment had tons of errors and was really vague), but overall the course was well-delivered. 8/10

**CSC263:** Data Structures & Analysis
**Prof:** Michelle Craig
**Crs Avg:** C+
**Me:** B-

Required CS course. This was the first ""difficult"" algorithms course, and goes through some heavyweight concepts like AVL trees, quicksort, graphs. All easy stuff once you're in 3rd or 4th year, but was quite dense. Michelle is another B-tier instructor in my books. Teaches clearly, but is otherwise unremarkable. Lots of studying, good amount of effort required, but content is pretty interesting. Assignments were relatively easy, but boy were the tests hard. I was genuinely scared that I would fail the final. I was absolutely humbled by this course, and it was the worst mark I've ever gotten. If I put more effort in I could've definitely done better but at this point I was definitely a bit overconfident. 7/10

**CSC343:** Introduction to Databases
**Prof:** Mark Kazakevich
**Crs Avg:** B+
**Me:** A

Basic database course with minimal theory. I took this course hoping to learn about database design and implementation, but this is taught in CSC443. Instead, I basically got a SQL tutorial course with set theory sprinkled in. Not the worst, but not the best. Mark was a fine instructor, but I don't think he teaches anymore(?). Assignments were quite long, and were done in partners. Midterm was hard, but final was possibly one of the easiest I've ever taken. Based on comparison to my friends, the difficulty of this course seems to be quite variable from year-to-year. 4/10

# Y3 (2022-2023)

**Summary:** This year was a weird one, since I was spending a lot of time on school, but also spending quite a bit of time looking for co-op (I did ASIP). This made everything a bit more difficult, which could skew my judgement.

**CSC309:** Programming on the Web
**Prof:** Kianoosh Abbasi
**Crs Avg:** B
**Me:** A

Your average web programming course, teaching HTML, CSS, JS, and a course project using React. Kianoosh is a great guy, but this course was completely unremarkable. Another one of those courses (IMO) where the content is just inherently uninteresting. 5/10

**CSC373:** Algorithm Design & Analysis 
**Prof:** Sam Toueg
**Crs Avg:** B-
**Me:** B+

Required CS course. Let me preface this by saying that Sam is an incredible lecturer. In terms of just teaching ability, I'd probably rank him top 3. That said, this course was a nightmare for me. Early morning lectures, no lecture recordings, incredibly dense slides, incredibly dense content, incredibly difficult assessments. This course is single-handedly responsible for more all-nighters than all of my other courses combined. My best recommendation for this course is to study the examples given in lecture very closely, as a lot of the explanations are quite convoluted for the sake of rigor. Later iterations of this course had full recordings (why?) and no autofail on the final (why?), which only adds to my misery. Such is the UofT experience. 7/10

**CSC369:** Operating Systems
**Prof:** Jack (Kuei) Sun (GOAT)
**Crs Avg:** B
**Me:** A

Required CS course. Jack is probably the GOAT of the CS department. Succinctly delivered lectures, willingness to answer and explain questions (and clearly knows his sh*t), extremely responsive on Piazza, and fair assessments. This course is infamous for being difficult along with CSC373, but I really enjoyed it and found the concepts really interesting. I do HIGHLY recommend reading and using the textbook when taking this course [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), which is truly a work of art (well written with good humour). Taking this course really solidified for me that I was on the right path in life, or at least not a wrong one. 9/10

**MAT235:** Multivariable Calculus
**Prof:** Forgor
**Crs Avg:** B-
**Me:** A-

Honestly I'm not sure what divine enlightenment compelled me to take this course (might've been a requirement to take ML?). I never showed up to a single lecture (ain't no way I'm showing up at 9 am for this), and studied 2 days before every test by doing an ungodly amount of practice questions. Completely uninspiring course. 1/10

**NFS284:** Basic Human Nutrition
**Prof:** Forgor
**Crs Avg:** B-
**Me:** NCR

When I took this course, it was online asynchronous and a complete joke. Now it's fully in person? Maybe the prof got tired of people calling his course a joke. 3/10 because I didn't learn anything and only remembered that I took this course because I was writing this post.

**CSC301:** Introduction to Software Engineering
**Prof:** David Jorjani
**Crs Avg:** A-
**Me:** A+

Extension to CSC207, but actually quite fun while still being really easy. Entire course was one big project in a large group (6-8 people iirc), where you could either do your own project or work with a real-world project. For the latter, basically you'll have real people such as professors at UofT that need a small application, and you'll build it for them based on their specifications. I did this with my group, and we built a webcam breathing tracker for the purpose of psychology surveys. Was really fun and chill, and came out with a great project. 8/10

**CSC324:** Principles of Programming Languages
**Prof:** Fan Long
**Crs Avg:** B-
**Me:** A-

Basically a deep dive into function programming. Course started out with Racket (why?), which is a toy language, and moved onto Haskell in later parts of the course. I struggle to understand why we started with Racket at all. Fan is another B-tier professor with all the indications of one (teaches clearly, but otherwise unremarkable). Full disclosure, this was probably one of my least liked courses in undergrad. However, I know many people who really enjoyed it, so it's a hit or miss depending on whether you like functional programming or not. 4/10

**CSC367:** Parallel Programming
**Prof:** Massimiliano Meneghin
**Crs Avg:** B+
**Me:** A+

This is a top 3 course for me. The content was super interesting, covering high performance caching techniques, distributed architectures, and GPU processing. We also got to use SciNet (Canada's largest supercomputer) to run experiments, which was janky (lots of random downtime disrupting assignments) but a really good experience overall. Assignments were really hard, each requiring multiple days of work to finish, but were really rewarding - essentially, each assignment was set up as an experiment report where you would test different caching techniques and optimizations and perform statistical analyses on them. Massimiliano was great, but was a guest lecturer so I doubt he'll teach this course again. After this course, I realized my interest for high performance systems, and I am happy to say that I am currently on this career path. I wish this course had a distributed computing extension 4th year course, which I definitely would have taken. 10/10

# Y4 (2023-2024)

**Summary:** I did 16 months of co-op from May 2023 to August 2024. My days became a constant repeat of wake up, go to work, go gym, make dinner, sleep. Sounds worse than it is, I really enjoyed the work that I did and had a great experience overall. For those wondering about ASIP, I did NOT find my job on the ASIP job portal and I had a lot more success going to career fairs and actually talking to recruiters. I only did 4 interviews in total, but spent an insane amount of time applying.

# Y5 (2024-2025)

**Summary:** Coming off my internship, I just wanted to get school over with, but I was dropped into possibly the hardest or second hardest semesters of school I had taken. Yippee. I was also doing interviews and applying to jobs a lot during this time.

**CSC311:** Machine Learning
**Prof:** Rahul G. Krishnan
**Crs Avg:** B
**Me:** A-

In terms of pure difficulty, this takes the cake as the single hardest course I've taken in undergrad at UofT. To be fair, I had just come off my 16-month co-op, so I wasn't well practiced at all in math or CS theory, but this course combines everything you've learned so far, from calculus to CS theory to probability and linear algebra, and to quite a high degree. I found Rahul to be a very good professor. Lectures were easy to follow, and he was quite responsive with answering questions. A lot of people like to hate on this course, but I think you should absolutely go into it expecting it to be the hardest course you take. This course changed my view of CS as a field significantly. I truly believe in this day and age having a basic understanding of ML (even if you don't go into the field) is a must, since it truly opens your eyes to understanding the idea behind lots of modern software products. 9/10

**CSC318:** The Design of Interactive Computational Media
**Prof:** Khai N. Truong
**Crs Avg:** A-
**Me:** A

Extremely birdy course if you're willing to do spoken presentations. Basically an extended semester-long hackathon in a large team (4-6). Recommend for being bird and quite fun. 8/10

**CSC401:** Natural Language Computing
**Prof:** Gerald Penn
**Crs Avg:** B
**Me:** A

To preface, Gerald is extremely intelligent and definitely knows what he is talking about. However, one look at his [Rate my prof](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/69474) tells you exactly what you need to know about how is as an instructor. To put it lightly, I would not take this course again. Extremely hard-to-follow lectures, where I was often so lost that I didn't even know where to begin to ask questions. The content itself really carried this course. Learning the content on my own was extremely interesting, especially learning about how to represent sounds and speech for machine learning models through transformers and GMMs. Assignments were quite dense, and in my experience most of the time was spent figuring out how to use the ML libraries rather than doing the actual assignment. However, this expectation (knowledge of ML libraries) is clearly listed and communicated, so I don't have too much of a problem. Start early and pray you don't get stuck somewhere. 5/10

**PHL233:** Philosophy for Scientists
**Prof:** Imogen Dickie
**Crs Avg:** C+
**Me:** A-

Whoever told me on Reddit that this was a ""bird course"" has to be out of their mind. In my experience, this course was highly involved, with weekly difficult readings, participation grades in tutorials, and marking was quite hard (although fair). Despite the non-birdiness, I really loved the teaching - Imogen is an amazing lecturer, and makes every lecture worth going to. I also really loved my TA and the discussion-style tutorials. I would only recommend this course if you like philosophy and literary analysis, as the readings and assignments are quite dense. Midterm and final were difficult in that the time constraints were insane (lots of short answer questions and essay-style answers). Especially the midterm, which left my hand twitching. 7/10

**CSC384:** Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
**Prof:** Bahar Aameri
**Crs Avg:** Not Yet Released
**Me:** B+

Honestly, after taking CSC401 and CSC311 the previous semester, this felt sorta useless, and to be honest I didn't put too much effort into this course. Content is barely mathematical, and is more of a ""AI logic"" course than what I would think an AI course is. Focus is more on things like game theory, state representation, and problem solving heuristics. Assignments and midterm were pretty easy, but the final was ridiculously difficult. I have never seen such a large spike in difficulty from previous content to the final in any other course. I thought Bahar was a good instructor overall, apart from the strangely difficult final. 6/10

**CSC458:** Computer Networks
**Prof:** Yashar Ganjali
**Crs Avg:** Not Yet Released
**Me:** A-

Top 3 favourite course in undergrad, maybe even top 1. I took this course, because in my opinion you cannot call yourself a CS graduate without networks knowledge. This course did not disappoint at all, mostly because of Yashar. Yashar was probably best instructor in terms of teaching and delivery I've had in all 4 years. Explains complicated concepts easily, and makes every lecture interesting and fun. You can tell he knows his field inside out, and has the credentials to back it up (look him up on Linkedin). No ego as well, takes every question seriously, and tells great stories that solidify concepts. Assignments were not hard at all once you understood the concept. Midterm and final were quite fair - difficult, but representative of what was taught (I probably should've studied more but interview szn got to me). I wish I could take another course offered by him, but alas, I must graduate. Easiest 10/10, if you see this guy teaching any course you should absolutely take it.

**CSC488:** Compilers and Interpreters
**Prof:** Fan Long
**Crs Avg:** Not Yet Released
**Me:** A

Similarly to u/heatfinix, I expected more from this course. You basically implement your own compiler over the course of the semester, based on LLVM (which is essentially a framework for writing compilers). The boilerplate is already written for you, so the work is essentially just figuring out how to use the framework. The content is interesting conceptually, but... I'm not sure. This isn't a knock on Fan, who teaches the content quite well, and in a non-confusing way. Maybe I was expecting to be more inspired to know more about compilers after this course, but all I feel now is an overwhelming sense of indifference. Final was quite easy. 6/10

**GGR252:** Marketing Geography
**Prof:** Stephen Swales
**Crs Avg:** Not Yet Released
**Me:** A-

This guy forces you to buy the textbook that HE WROTE for $120, since the marked quizzes for this course are in the textbook itself (online textbook). I'm not sure if this is common practice in other departments, but this rubbed me the wrong way. Stephen is a good lecturer, but the content of this course is honestly 80% common sense. I think I only went to 2 lectures total, and the 2 hour final was a joke, with the majority of students leaving within an hour. Take this course if you're willing to pay $120 for easy marks. I only got an A- because I was too lazy to do the majority of the textbook quizzes (sigh). 5/10

# Conclusion

I thought about going to grad school, but I was too lazy to apply, and already had a job lined up anyways. So yeah, I'll be selling out my soul to big tech, which I honestly have mixed feelings about that I won't get into. Honestly, though the job prospects of CS were an upside, I didn't do CS because of it, and I've only stayed because I believe I truly enjoy learning CS. If you want my 2 cents about the industry as a whole, software engineering is not dead, and never will be, and AI won't be replacing the field. However, it will increasingly become a top heavy field, where just being an ""okay"" computer scientist will not be enough. Skilled computer scientists, with the help of AI, will become devs that are magnitudes more productive than the average dev. Think about it this way, 10x developers will now become 100x developers. If you're just in it for the money and don't actually enjoy computer science as a concept, there may be better things to do with your time.

# Recommendations

**1. Don't rely too much on AI.** GenAI only became usable during my last year of study, and I saw a lot of people just plugging sh*t in and pasting directly to their assignments. Remember, you're here to learn, and GenAI is a great way to pass your courses while not learning a single thing. If you can't answer basic conceptual questions, you won't be employable, and you'll be more and more lost as you take harder courses. Vibe coding **WILL** inevitably bite you in the ass later, and I'm glad I did the majority of my degree without the option to.

**2. Job search.** The job search is both a numbers game and a resource allocation game. And in my experience, that's the best way to look at it: it's a game that everyone is playing. In my experience, the highest return (for cold applications) is found when you put out a set number of quality applications in at a set time period. For me, I put in 5 applications a week, with tailored resume and cover letter, setting a 30 minute timer to modify my resume and cover letter for each application. This is not a ton of time, as if you do one a day, it's only 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. What you SHOULD be spending a good amount of time doing, and gives the highest return overall, is making connections. Go on Linkedin, look for UofT grads working in companies you want to look at, and message them. Ask your parents, your friends, and your friends' friends/family for referrals. The more shameless you are, the better, and honestly people are generally willing to help others (in this case, you). This will get your foot in the door much more often.

**3. Social life.** A common complaint about UofT is the lack of social life. I was lucky to have a lot of friends at UofT, which made the entire experience a lot easier and more fun. School isn't worth losing your social life for. Read that sentence again, and convince yourself, because it's true. If you don't have time for both, you're either doing something very wrong, or your major is not for you. Not once in my undergrad (except for interview season) did I not have time to go out with friends twice a week, even during finals.",90,16,2025-05-10 22:06:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1kjq8ji/rating_and_reviewing_every_course_i_took_at_uoft/,"['and moved onto', 'Content', 'Mario', 'Jack', 'I really loved the teaching - Imogen', 'Everything', 'or your major', 'software engineering', 'Possibly minor', 'everything here', 'where the content', 'This', 'Such', 'but all I feel now', 'Course had significant teaching or assessment', 'Danny', 'Steve', 'active', 'Content is', 'so the work', ""I'm not sure if this"", 'but this', 'Kianoosh', 'delivery', 'Let me preface this by saying that Sam', 'Sounds worse than it', 'course than what I would think an AI course', ""it's a game that everyone"", 'Hakob', 'John', 'Focus', 'The content', 'but content', 'My best recommendation for this course', 'tells you exactly what you need to know about how', 'I was', 'changes your outlook', 'I am currently', 'Hopefully this helps someone or just', 'and GenAI', 'The job search', 'A common complaint about UofT', 'Michelle', 'The boilerplate', 'but the content of this course', 'School', 'This course', 'which', 'Stephen', 'UofT']",0.11846361185983834,False,0.94

1kvby1w,yorku,I'm about to be homeless with my last year to go through. Any advice?,"Hi there!
As the title suggests, I'm leaving ""home""; currently in maple with absolutely nothing except for 2k to my name. My parents are insane and incredibly controlling so there's a few things I'm worried about. 

My dad has my passport which I know to find before i leave, but he also didn't allow me to do anything for myself. So he has a lot of logins for the important things I'd need in the future, like my OSAP funding for my last year of university in September, and all taxes were done by him too. 

I'll be able to get my passport, drivers license, SIN, health card etc but I'm unsure of were to go after leaving too tbh. I know york u campus pretty well so I figured I could hide out in some corner for a little bit.
But my main concern where I'd really really love some assistance or advice would be getting a job and a place to stay permanently.

I know that I'd be a valuable hire, but thanks to my parents, I barely have any experience to prove it. I've just got 1 summers worth of job experience as a Food safety/quality assurance worker in a factory that handled food.
These days everything works through references and connections so please, help this internet stranger out.

I know this is typed out super weirdly but my brain is going a mile a minute right now and I just wanna plan this out and leave ASAP. Thanks a bunch in advance üôè ",71,25,2025-05-25 16:15:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/1kvby1w/im_about_to_be_homeless_with_my_last_year_to_go/,"['So he', 'My dad']",0.11420068027210885,False,1.0
1ksy37d,yorku,I have nothing to do over the summer and can‚Äôt find a job,"I‚Äôve been rotting away trying to find a job for months now, but now being on break for 4 months I have literally nothing to do. Finding a job is impossible, and I didn‚Äôt take any summer courses which I maybe should‚Äôve done lmao. 

But does anyone know any jobs I could apply for on campus or anything I could do that would actually b productive over the summer even if it‚Äôs not paid. Getting a job isn‚Äôt that necessary for me rn since I‚Äôm at home, it would‚Äôve been nice, but everyone knows how the job market is rn. 

and I already have enough volunteer experience to make my resume decent so ion wanna just keep doing the same stuff again. 

Any advice?? üò≠üò≠üò≠",38,12,2025-05-22 14:28:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/1ksy37d/i_have_nothing_to_do_over_the_summer_and_cant/,"['Getting a job', 'but everyone knows how the job market', 'Finding a job']",0.0875,False,0.96
