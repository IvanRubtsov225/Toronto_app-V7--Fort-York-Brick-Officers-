Any recommendations?,2,7,2025-05-26 08:01:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodToronto/comments/1kvsluk/what_did_you_eat_this_weekendweek_may_26_2025/,AutoModerator,1.0,True
1kw3vbn,FoodToronto,My Restaurant List,"Hi Y'all,

I have been working on a restaurant List bc I get asked a lot about which restaurant to go to in Toronto from Friends/Family visiting. Below is essentially my first draft, what are your thoughts?

BTW, it leans queen west heavily bc thats the area I live in.

* [Le Swan](https://leswan.ca/) (French/Diner) – Half diner, half French bistro, this cozy and intimate spot is one of my haunts. The food is straight forward, well executed, and thoughtfully balanced. Excellent cocktails that play on bar standards. It is a tight space, so groups of more than four are not advised. Overall, not spectacular, but comforting and delicious. The ideal spot for a weeknight dinner. (not open for lunch).
* [Le Select Bistro](https://www.leselectbistro.com/) (French) – A Toronto institution and favourite of mine. This is not boundary pushing, but they consistently at deliver great takes on French bistro classics. I dream of their cassoulet in the winter. It's also an enormous space, so great if you are ever dealing with a larger group or looking to book a space. (Open for lunch)
* [Enoteca Sociale](https://sociale.ca/) (Italian) – This Roman spot is all about the tender house made fresh pasta. Comfortable environment and very welcoming staff, this has become a local favourite for a reason. (Not open for lunch)
* [Dreyfus](https://dreyfustoronto.com/) (French) – Another small French bistro, but with a Canadian contemporary influence. The food here is delicious, rich and comforting. Good wine list as well. I always leave Dreyfus with a full belly and having drunk a little too much wine, ideally you should be able to sleep in the next morning. Situated on the first floor of a town house, this is a very small restaurant so book ahead of time. (Not open for lunch)
* [Soos](https://www.soostoronto.com/) (Malay) – Another addition from Ossington St. This is (reportedly) authentic Malaysian cooking with contemporary twists. I love this place for the Sambal chili sauce, which they will sell you in jars to take home. Also, a great option if you are dining with someone with dietary restrictions, they have plenty of good vegan options and are good at accommodations. (Not open for lunch)
* [Union](https://union72.ca/) (French) – The space is appealingly rustic and so is the food. If you sit at the counter, the chef sometimes will serve your dish and stick around to talk about it. Perhaps not the most refined, but Union brings flavour in spades, this place makes me happy. Also they have one of my preferred brunches in the city. (Open for lunch)
* [Sushi Yugen](https://sushiyugen.ca/restaurant/) (Sushi, duh) – I’m not well acquainted with the world of high-end sushi. What I can tell you is this place is awesome. They only do omakase, of which there are two levels. I went here for my 30^(th) birthday for the chef’s counter omakase, and it was without a doubt one of the best meals I’ve ever had. Traditional décor, service is excellent and serious. The female servers wear authentic and ornate kimonos which is a fun touch. (Open for lunch)
* [Quetzal](https://www.quetzaltoronto.com/) (Mexican) – To be honest, I haven’t made it here yet. I felt I needed to include it on here for both it’s critical reputation as well as its revered status amongst many of my friends. From what I hear it’s all the fantastic things about high-end Mexican food. Smokey charred flavours, excellent Ceviche, deep and complex sauces. (Not open for Lunch)
* [Sunny’s Chinese](https://www.sunnyschinese.com/) (Chinese obviously) – In the back of weird hallway in Kensington market, this is a great and hip restaurant. Spicy food abounds in these mouthwatering homestyle shared plates. If you enjoy Szechuan spice, this is for you. black bean fish and Mapo Tofu are my personal favorites. (Not open for lunch)
* [Grey Gardens](https://greygardens.ca/) (Canadian Contemporary) – One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The cocktails are always changing and the are no wrong choices. People more knowledgeable than myself tell me the wine list is also very good.  The smoked fish dip must be ordered; creamy, briny, and bursting with umami. They make smart contemporary dishes that take inspiration from a myriad of different cuisines. Pasta is also very good here. (Not open for lunch)
* [Mamakas](https://mamakas.ca/mamakas/) (Greek) - “Greek food better than what we had in Greece” – CBC food critic Elizabeth Carson, 2024. Fantastic food and friendly service. The space is designed to feel fun and lively which matches a menu of fairly big portions meant to be shared. The meatballs are to die for, seeming to liquifying when bitten. Not your traditional Moussaka, but a very good one with a modern twist.  If you can bring a big group its useful in that you can order more dishes. (Open for lunch on weekends)
* [Imanishi](https://www.imanishi.ca/) (Izakaya) – The first restaurant I went to when I moved to Toronto six years ago, it remains in my frequent rotation to this day. A playful and multicultural take on Izakaya, the menu changes all the time. The corn karaage are little golden bundles of joy that have an almost funnel cake texture. I will say that the seating is not particularly comfortable, and you may end up on a stool. (Not open for lunch)
* [Vinoteca Pompette](https://www.pompette.ca/) (Italian) –They very recently rebranded from Pompette to Vinoteca Pompette, and with that have gone from French to Italian food. I have not been since their rebrand. Setting aside their identity crisis, the kitchen here deserves to all the hype it has been lauded with. Really well considered dishes, elegant and unctuous. If you go for Sunday dinner, they have an alternative menu which can be fun (Not open for lunch)
* [Parallel](https://parallelbrothers.com/geary-restaurant/) (Middle eastern) – My favorite falafel in the city. Parallel serves up lovely herbaceous dishes that lean a little to the rustic side. They are known for their mezze, which they sold commercially before the opened the restaurant and still do now. The patio is well covered and heated, so it is pleasant for most of the year. They recently started a second location in Kensington Market, but I have not been able to visit yet. (Open for lunch)
* [Richmond Station](https://richmondstation.ca/) (Contemporary) – Located in an unassuming spot in the financial district, this little gem makes tasty food with consistency. Dished here come from a wide variety of inspirations, but broadly speaking mostly European and North American. What I find is that means there is always something for everyone on the menu. While not a burger place by any means, they do make a fantastic one if you are dining with someone who would be interested. You will want to sit in the main room further back in the restaurant, the bar space in the front is less pleasant. (Open for lunch)
* Forno Cultura, Queen Location (Italian Bakery) – Forno Cultura has become a part of my weekend ritual. Every Sunday I have a slow morning and then walk over to at lunch for a sandwich, a coffee, and a delightful pastry or baked good. On Sundays they have a Meatball sub that is the stuff of dreams, but all the sandwich options pull their weight. Pastry wise, hard to go wrong here, but I do bring home their biscotti to Calgary for the Holidays. One the weekend their sandwiches can sell out by 1:30/2:00. (Open for lunch)
* [Favourites](https://www.myfavethai.com/) (Thai BBQ) Hidden on Ossington St., this unassuming spot is not your normal Thai restaurant. They use their charcoal grill to great effect, marrying charred and smokey elements to classic Thai flavours. They also innovate by mixing in all sorts of techniques and inspirations from other cuisines. The duck confit with red curry is a dish I enjoy immensely.  (Not open for lunch)
* [Writer’s Room](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/canada/park-hyatt-toronto/torph/dining/writers-room-bar) (Contemporary) – The bar/restaurant on the 17^(th) floor of the Park Hyatt Yorkville. A very cool space with gorgeous sweeping views of Downtown Toronto. Dining here is shared with plenty of tasty bites to pick from, but really, I come here for the drinks and the view. Some of the best cocktails I’ve had in the city come from the bevy of talented bartenders they employ.
* [Koukla](https://mamakas.ca/bar-koukla/) (Greek) – Sister operation and direct neighbour to Mamakas, Koukla is a bar most of the time, with good drinks and good food. Frankly, if you're going for dinner I would suggest you go to Mamakas instead. However, on weekends is when Koukla truly shines they make one of the best brunch/lunches around. The Baklava pancakes are a must order. (Open for lunch on weekends)
* [Cote De Bouef](https://cotedeboeuf.ca/#bar) (French) – Casual and rustic, this yet another little French bistro also doubles as a butcher and prepared foods store is incredibly charming. Expect classic French fair played straight and executed well. Always get the terrine de jour, which does actually rotate out on a daily basis. Obviously, protein is their forte here, and they have yet to disappoint me.

1kvqnzl,askTO,Megathread: HOUSING? (2)," 

There are a few purpose built rentals (PBR) aka all rental buildings. Some do advertise on the rental sites, however some do not. The demand is so high here that they easily fill empty units before needing to pay for advertising outside of their own websites!

Here's one [article](https://torontoism.com/purpose-built-rentals-toronto/) \- not sure if you want to post this link or list them separately. Companies like [Minto](https://www.mintoapartments.com/gta/apartment-rentals/projects.html), [Tridel](https://www.tridel.com/rentals-resales/), [Oxford](https://www.oxfordresidential.ca/), [KG](https://www.myrental.ca/) have a few buildings in the city. These are the ones I'm familiar with, no doubt there are more.

For the summer and short term rentals, there are the university student residences .... time limited advice though since students return in the Fall!

University of Toronto has New College, very central to downtown. Here are the [UofT's summer residences](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/task/summer-residence/). There's Toronto Metropolitan (TMU, formerly Ryerson) as well. [TMU summer residences](https://www.torontomu.ca/summer-stay/).

For short term stays, some may be interested in [hostelworld.com](https://hostelworld.com/) until they can secure a longer term rental.

edit: some of these all rental buildings have waiting lists.

1kw6g4h,askTO,"Looking for any footage - May 14, Brimley & 401 Accident","Hi everyone. As the title suggests, I am looking for any footage of an accident that happened on Brimley & 401 on Wed, May 14 between 10:07 and 10:10 AM. The accident happened while exiting from Express to Collectors.

I was driving my White Elantra N in the right most lane when a Black Honda HRV from the lane beside me suddenly merged in. I tried to brake but couldn’t do so in time, and ended up rear-ending the car.

My car was flipped while the HRV was hit and ended up hitting the curb. The officer did not get my official statement and gave me a Careless Driving ticket while I was in the ambulance getting assessed. I was at the hospital for 12 hours, and not once did any cop come to speak to me or ask for my statement, while they spoke to the passengers of the other car multiple times at the scene and hospital.

I am 23 years old who saved up for years for this car, and this charge is not an accurate representation of what happened. This charge will also negatively impact my insurance, and even get me kicked off for something that is not my fault. I was not carelessly driving at all, I was just in my lane the whole time. I even had a truck driver come pull me out of the car after the incident and tell me it was not my fault. 

I do not have a dash cam - I am requesting if anyone has any dashcam or CCTV footage that can prove my innocence, I would really appreciate it. I am trying really hard to fight and prove I was not in the wrong, and if anyone has any information or footage, it would mean an incredible amount.

I'm also willing to offer compensation for footage.

TLDR: Involved in accident which is being blamed on me along with being charged with Careless Driving, but I do not have dashcam to prove my innocence. Looking for anyone or any footage that can help show I was not in the wrong and do not deserve this charge.",64,13,2025-05-26 17:43:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1kw6g4h/looking_for_any_footage_may_14_brimley_401/,NintendoGamer93,0.93,True

1kg9cho,askTO,Was I wrong to wait for someone else to run onto the bus?,"This morning I got on one of the ttc busses and as I was getting on I saw a girl running to the stop (she was about 5 metres away) so I lowkey stepped into the entrance, checked my presto balance for like 2 seconds then continued, just so the girl had enough time to get on. After I did that, the bus driver screams at me and told me that next time he will leave me on the side of the road and that he knows where I’m going (idk how he knows). The bus was actually running a couple minutes early so i didn’t really think much about the extra 5 seconds I might’ve wasted.

Next stop someone else was running to the bus too and just about made it in front of the doors but he shut them on her and took off. 

I understand ttc drivers have a schedule to follow and deal with a lot but I feel as though he didn’t have to threaten me and I’m not sure what he means by saying he knows where I’m going (I’m a girl so this is kinda creepy if he does know). 

I thought it’d be a somewhat nice thing to do bc I get the stress of missing a bus but maybe it was stupid of me bc I guess most people should plan ahead of time?

1khd5t3,TorontoEvents,"Reddit Toronto May Meetup: Sat. May 17 @ Queen & Broadview, 7:00 p.m. start","Come drink, eat, and hang out with fellow Toronto Redditors looking to make friends and connect on Saturday, May 17, at the Toronto Reddit May meetup - The Long Weekend May 2-4 Edition! It's free to attend and there is no official RSVP, however our reservation requires each person to order something, even if it's just a glass of soda.

We're changing our venue this time to [Duke's Refresher Riverside](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/) at 709 Queen Street East (Queen and Broadview), as our regular venue The Artful Dodger closes their upstairs area over the summer.

If you've never been to a Reddit meetup, everyone is very welcoming and conversations always extend beyond the Reddit platform itself, with no questions about your username. If you are returning, you'll likely recognize some faces, but there are always new folx to meet.

**FAQ:**

* **How do I find the group?:** We'll be on the second level of Duke's Refresher.
* **Am I welcome?:** Everyone is welcome, from visitors to newcomers to people looking to make new friends.
* **Will people my age be there?:** Based on my experiences over the years, the average age of attendees is 20-40.
* **Will women be there?:** Yes! I'm a woman, so you won't be the only woman there.
* **Will I make new friends/connections?:** Everyone who attends is looking for a different experience, but the commonality is getting out, meeting new people and having a good time. I have been attending since 2018 & hosting since 2022. I've made friends I've traveled with and attended some weddings and I still keep in touch with a few out-of-towners. You can make these connections from attending a single (1) meetup (I've seen it happen a lot), so if you're thinking it will be a waste of time to come just once, it's not - anything is possible.
* **How often do you have these events?:** I aim to host one event a month. These have typically been Saturdays starting between 7-8 p.m. I aim to post my events with reasonable notice, including reminders.
* **Does it cost money to attend?:** Though there is no cost to attend the event itself, we ask that you purchase a drink and/or food to support the venue, as they have to turn away other paying customers to fill our reservation. If you do not wish to eat or drink anything, you could tip $5-10 to the staff as a courtesy.
* **What are the food/drink options like?:** There are vegetarian, vegan and non-alcoholic options available, and they are allergy-friendly. [Menu link](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/)
* **Is the venue accessible?** Unfortunately, the venue has stairs and is not fully accessible.

If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment publicly or message me privately. I keep an eye on my account leading up to and during the event, and though I try to respond to messages as soon as possible, I may not be able to reply right away during the event.

If you read all of that, kudos! If not, see TL;DR below.

your hosts, u/imop44 and u/nervousTO.

**TL;DR:** This unofficial Reddit meetup is Saturday, May 17, at 709 Queen Street East (Queen & Broadview). Starts at 7:00 p.m., ends when the last people leave or the bar closes. Everyone is welcome and there is no RSVP, but attendees are required to make a purchase at the venue as part of our reservation's conditions.

Anyways, my name is Trae, I run these events called Block Party in Montreal and Toronto based on the mentality of throwing house parties at club attendance and amenities. Moving here for university, I found the nightlife scene wasn't the same as my hometown, Toronto seems to be very business oriented versus creating the most enjoyable event for people and I'd like to change that (with my minimal budget and a lot of friends from university). I'm throwing an event called NO FLYERS on the 31st and hopefully people here enjoy the concept of a Toronto event where we're all enjoying ourselves at the same price point, with good music and vibes.

1kt8m3i,TorontoEvents,I built a new Toronto sports meetup platform — looking for more players nearby,"Hey all! I recently built a platform called [Sportiner](https://sportiner.com/) that makes it easy for people in the Toronto area to find others to play sports with — tennis, basketball, soccer, running, cycling, whatever you’re into.

A bunch of people have already signed up from different parts of the GTA like Thornhill, Mississauga, Richmond Hill, and downtown. The idea is simple:  
\- Post a game or join one  
\- Meet people near you who play your sport  
\- Chat in-app and organize games more easily

Right now, we’re just getting started, so if you’re into sports and looking to meet new people this summer, would love for you to check it out.  
→ [sportiner.com](https://sportiner.com/)

It’s free, no spam, just something I built because I was tired of chasing group chats that go nowhere 😅

Let me know what you think — and if you join, feel free to DM me or drop a game! Would be awesome to see some of you there.",2,0,2025-05-22 22:24:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1kt8m3i/i_built_a_new_toronto_sports_meetup_platform/,SpareClue4844,0.67,True
