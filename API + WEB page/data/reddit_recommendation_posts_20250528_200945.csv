1kxthjx,askTO,Why doesn’t the City have 24/7 roadwork crews during construction season?,"Every time I drive around Toronto during construction season, I see blocked off lanes and half-completed work zones — but no one is actually working. Day after day, the same lanes are closed, yet there’s no activity during evenings, overnights, or even weekends in many cases.

This city is gridlocked for months at a time, and it inconveniences thousands of people daily. With the volume of commuters, deliveries, emergency services, and public transit impacted — why aren’t we working around the clock to get this stuff done faster?

I know the city recently made allowances for certain extended construction hours, which is a start — but why not go all the way to 24/7 work, especially on major infrastructure like highways? (ie. Gardiner) Most of that work doesn’t generate disruptive sound pollution for nearby residential areas anyway, so what’s the holdup?

Instead of these projects dragging on for 2–3 years, we could realistically cut timelines in half (or less) with around-the-clock shifts. There are also plenty of labourers and tradespeople currently looking for steady work. Wouldn’t this be a win-win?

Is the issue budget? Union contracts? Genuinely curious what’s stopping this from happening. Or do they just want us to suffer?

If anyone works in the industry or has insight, I’d love to understand the reasoning?",24,27,2025-05-28 17:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1kxthjx/why_doesnt_the_city_have_247_roadwork_crews/,jump5back,0.78,True
1kxqxxd,askTO,Weekend in Toronto,"Hi everyone, 

My 93 year old grandfather is a big MLB fan, and has had a dream for a long time of visiting every park in the league. So as a birthday, my mother and I are surprising him with a trip to Toronto to see the Blue Jays play the White Sox, his favorite team and to check Rogers Centre off his list. (No idea why he picked that team to be a fan of but that's his cross to bear lol)

I created a basic itinerary more or less, with the typical stuff like the CN tower observation deck, ROM, St Lawrence Market, Harbourfront+a boat ride etc, but I want to try out and bring him around to more cool spots in the city that aren't as egregiously touristic in nature. Does anyone have any ideas of cool spots or restaurants that aren't as tourist trappy type? My family coming along loves food so there are no restrictions of any kind, whether it be the typical American/Canadian fare like burgers and what not or more ethnic places. We're from Chicago so we are well versed in city restaurants and the diversity they include. Potentially any type of Indian or Filipino, or any ethnicity/restaurant that is common in the GTA but not in Chicago? (That's a hard ask I know, two cities with large immigrant backgrounds) We're already gonna hit Timmy's to check out the hype and see if it's better than Dunkin lol

The only issue is that his knees have given out and in the past few years he's developed a few mobility issues, so we'll probably be bringing a little wheelchair to use here and there. Accessible places would be nice but are not 100% necessary, it's not like he can't walk at all and he still has some pep in his step. We're staying at some hotel right nearby Scotiabank but my mother might be renting a car (tbd) so ideas for any cool spot worth a trek in the GTA would be nice.

1kxq22r,askTO,travel Canada day week to Toronto,"My husband, kids (2 x 11 yrs old) and I are travelling to Toronto for Canada day week, we arrive super early in the morning of Monday the 30th (the day that seems to be being clocked as the canada day stat holiday off) and might not be able to check in that early - looking for some interesting options to do /go for breakfast and rest of the morning while we wait for check in time (could be as late as 3pm). our hotel is near the airport and we are not renting a car - planning to use train/bus/subway and uber. looking for any recommendations that would be both open and fun and not super tiring as the kids will probably be lower energy. Also for July 1 - it seems like there's a million different places doing Canada day festivities and fireworks. are there any that are typically ""the best?"" the ones we have in our home town are pretty lame with a bouncy castle, a wedding singer and like 3 minutes of fireworks so anything will probably be better - but would be awesome to hear locals perspectives of which ones are really good.

1kg9cho,askTO,Was I wrong to wait for someone else to run onto the bus?,"This morning I got on one of the ttc busses and as I was getting on I saw a girl running to the stop (she was about 5 metres away) so I lowkey stepped into the entrance, checked my presto balance for like 2 seconds then continued, just so the girl had enough time to get on. After I did that, the bus driver screams at me and told me that next time he will leave me on the side of the road and that he knows where I’m going (idk how he knows). The bus was actually running a couple minutes early so i didn’t really think much about the extra 5 seconds I might’ve wasted.

Next stop someone else was running to the bus too and just about made it in front of the doors but he shut them on her and took off. 

I understand ttc drivers have a schedule to follow and deal with a lot but I feel as though he didn’t have to threaten me and I’m not sure what he means by saying he knows where I’m going (I’m a girl so this is kinda creepy if he does know). 

I thought it’d be a somewhat nice thing to do bc I get the stress of missing a bus but maybe it was stupid of me bc I guess most people should plan ahead of time?

1kxd2yn,toronto,Elevator Assault in the GTA,"So I was coming back from a walk yesterday and got on the elevator with an older man with whitish hair. He had a huge dog and told me he was Iranian.

He then continued to repeated say, ""you're a beautiful baby, do you know that that? You're a beautiful baby."" After that he tried to squeeze my jaw/cheeks, put his hand behind my neck and tried to push my head into his for a kiss. :c At that moment I finally snapped back and asked him what he was doing, to which he responded ""I just want to know you better, do you want to have my contact?"" Of course I said no, but he was persistent and even wanted to hold my hand before he got off (he was reluctant to get off the elevator too).
For what happened, I'm wondering if I should call the police or at least tell the building superintendent.
 
I rent an apartment, and this man lives in the same building as me. This has never happened to me before, and I'm just starting to realize how not ok it was for him to behave this way.

1khd5t3,TorontoEvents,"Reddit Toronto May Meetup: Sat. May 17 @ Queen & Broadview, 7:00 p.m. start","Come drink, eat, and hang out with fellow Toronto Redditors looking to make friends and connect on Saturday, May 17, at the Toronto Reddit May meetup - The Long Weekend May 2-4 Edition! It's free to attend and there is no official RSVP, however our reservation requires each person to order something, even if it's just a glass of soda.

We're changing our venue this time to [Duke's Refresher Riverside](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/) at 709 Queen Street East (Queen and Broadview), as our regular venue The Artful Dodger closes their upstairs area over the summer.

If you've never been to a Reddit meetup, everyone is very welcoming and conversations always extend beyond the Reddit platform itself, with no questions about your username. If you are returning, you'll likely recognize some faces, but there are always new folx to meet.

**FAQ:**

* **How do I find the group?:** We'll be on the second level of Duke's Refresher.
* **Am I welcome?:** Everyone is welcome, from visitors to newcomers to people looking to make new friends.
* **Will people my age be there?:** Based on my experiences over the years, the average age of attendees is 20-40.
* **Will women be there?:** Yes! I'm a woman, so you won't be the only woman there.
* **Will I make new friends/connections?:** Everyone who attends is looking for a different experience, but the commonality is getting out, meeting new people and having a good time. I have been attending since 2018 & hosting since 2022. I've made friends I've traveled with and attended some weddings and I still keep in touch with a few out-of-towners. You can make these connections from attending a single (1) meetup (I've seen it happen a lot), so if you're thinking it will be a waste of time to come just once, it's not - anything is possible.
* **How often do you have these events?:** I aim to host one event a month. These have typically been Saturdays starting between 7-8 p.m. I aim to post my events with reasonable notice, including reminders.
* **Does it cost money to attend?:** Though there is no cost to attend the event itself, we ask that you purchase a drink and/or food to support the venue, as they have to turn away other paying customers to fill our reservation. If you do not wish to eat or drink anything, you could tip $5-10 to the staff as a courtesy.
* **What are the food/drink options like?:** There are vegetarian, vegan and non-alcoholic options available, and they are allergy-friendly. [Menu link](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/)
* **Is the venue accessible?** Unfortunately, the venue has stairs and is not fully accessible.

If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment publicly or message me privately. I keep an eye on my account leading up to and during the event, and though I try to respond to messages as soon as possible, I may not be able to reply right away during the event.

If you read all of that, kudos! If not, see TL;DR below.

your hosts, u/imop44 and u/nervousTO.

**TL;DR:** This unofficial Reddit meetup is Saturday, May 17, at 709 Queen Street East (Queen & Broadview). Starts at 7:00 p.m., ends when the last people leave or the bar closes. Everyone is welcome and there is no RSVP, but attendees are required to make a purchase at the venue as part of our reservation's conditions. I'll be keeping an eye on post comments and my messages between now and Saturday the 17th, so please connect with me if you have any questions.",2,2,2025-05-07 20:33:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1khd5t3/reddit_toronto_may_meetup_sat_may_17_queen/,nervousTO,0.67,True
