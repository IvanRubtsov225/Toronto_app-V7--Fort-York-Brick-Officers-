- Japanese food is probably better in Vancouver. There's so much more homecooked restaurants and variety. Raisu was a standout restaurant in particular, and Toki Doki all the way in Tofino was unexpectedly good with their okonomiyaki. It's like twice the price of Okonomi House though.
- Nero Belgian waffles were awesome with their brussels waffles egg benedict on smoked salmon and hot sauce. They were light, airy, and crisp. Toronto is lacking in good waffle brunch spots. I'm tired of fat sugary stacks of pancakes that make you feel sick after eating a quarter üòÆ‚Äçüí®
- I tried John 3:16 for Malaysian food but the spices were weak, Soos had much stronger flavour and wok hei with their roti and char kway teow.

If you get fired with no severance at the end of the month and get hit by a bus on the 1st, you could suddenly be hundreds of thousands in medical debt. My parents also had great health insurance, until my mom got cancer and had to retire before Medicare (state insurance for elderly) kicked in. My dad worked until age 75 to be able to pay for her cancer treatments and avoid leaving us in debt. He died a month after he stopped working. 2. It‚Äôs complicated. It‚Äôs a bitch to navigate. In network, out of network, HMO, PPO, referrals. Your HR should help you navigate this but it‚Äôs truthfully just annoying. For someone who‚Äôs never navigated it either, your HR isn‚Äôt going to always be a truly straight source (especially if you change jobs or are considering offers and are trying to compare benefit packages and costs‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre probably going to oversell its value and undersell how much it‚Äôs actually going to cost you. You have to do independent research.)

Political situation- I think other comments do a good job detailing this, but just to reiterate - it‚Äôs, uh, not good! Blue states are *somewhat* insulated but not that much‚Ä¶ this administration is trampling over states rights and judicial law, so one of the most terrifying things right now is how little power blue states really have. Before I moved I was on the emergency pick up list for 4 of my neighbors school kids in case there were raids. The economic situation is more tenuous than ever - so job security anywhere is not solid. I know I sound alarmist but I have to admit when I hear people consider moving to the US right now sometimes I think I hear ‚Äúshould I move to Germany in 1933?‚Äù 

Maybe a lesser but still something to think about longer term: Raising a family here is tough. I had a direct comparison to my sibling raising my nephews across the border while I was raising my kiddos. My state and Washington are one of only six states that give 12 weeks paid leave for new parents - but that‚Äôs it. We paid $2600/month for an infant in daycare. With a toddler and preschooler it was $3800/month. It‚Äôd be slightly higher in Seattle. In state tuition per year at a good state university is $30,000/year. Even in blue states, even in the same school district, schools are mostly funded by property tax so there is massive amounts of education inequity - even more than in Canada. Your health insurance may be good now for individuals but may start to escalate if you have a family. Guns (not much more to be said there.) Again - family issues though could be a complete nonstarter, so putting this last.",37,"['Your health insurance', 'In state tuition per year', 'You have to do', 'White collar jobs', 'For someone who', 'Blue states are', 'You have', 'Health insurance', 'My parents also had great health', 'The economic situation', 'Your health', 'Before I moved I was', 'American who recently', 'Toronto and have', 'Political situation', 'Two big caveats', 'Health', 'Even']",0.09902158952158954,1,1,0,2025-05-05 09:19:19,moosetracks4life,True

\- Expect to pay more for healthcare. That won't eradicate the benefits of the salary boost, but FYI even when your employer offers for insurance, they subsidize the plan amounts but often don't fully cover it. So for example, there is a 'free' plan, and then monthly cost plans. I pay about 100-200ish a month for my plan via my employer, and then pay 35 copay per visit, plus then, pay for services like ultrasounds up until my deductible is met. It's not terrible if you're reasonably healthy and the plan is ok, but, if you have any recurring medications you take, a history of anything in your family, etc., it'd be worthwhile to check how must that will run you. (Also, having a baby costs like 10k in hospitals here? Take that into account if you want kids...)

\- Seattle and Toronto have very different vibes as cities, and you're going to meet very different people. Toronto is more like New York, US-city wise. Seattle is sorta like Vancouver, but with more big tech people (Amazon, Microsoft) than Vancouver. I know some people who have moved to Seattle and it took them a long time to find friends-- hard to find people into the same stuff, etc. But, if you're super outdoorsy, lots of folks into that there!

\- The weather in Seattle will be warmer but I've heard it rains and is gray a lot. If the Toronto winters get you down, the Seattle gray season (aka most of the year) may not be much of an improvement.

\- For the first year, you'll pay taxes to US and Canada (not in full-- there is a trade agreement, but with Trump... who knows what will happen with that.) After that, just US. But then, your Canadian bank accounts will count as 'foreign investments'. If you have a lot of money in mutual funds etc, prepare to get rid of all of it, or get taxed like crazy. You'll need to open 401k etc here in the US, and then if you ever want to move back, deal with moving it over. Not impossible, just a hassle.

\- Being in the US right now is... weird vibes. I've been where for awhile but being on a visa and knowing I could be deported at a moment's notice, if my company say has layoffs or if the administration has a whim... It's a low undercurrent of constant stress.

if you have/want kids, private school is pretty much the only option - consider the 10-30K/yr cost of that. plus college/university is stupid expensive, too. 2 kids + healthcare will prob be between $60K-80K USD/yr, for example. if you want a nice home in a nice neighbourhood, add HOA fees, 3-800/M, so another 4-10K/yr. about total $65-90K/yr, depending where in the 'middle class' spectrum you want to be. that puts your salary increase at $75-100K ignoring taxes, as in Washington it'll be roughly about the same.

About 1/3 of the U.S. population has a criminal record: https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/criminal-records-and-reentry-toolkit

While you'd think you won't face criminal charges because you are not a criminal, my best friend thought exactly the same thing as a physician working in the U.S. and ended up a felon (which destroyed his life utterly from a financial perspective. Now he's driving Uber at age 50 to make ends meet).

By comparison, about 10% of Canadians have a criminal record: https://johnhoward.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Criminal-Records-Act-Reform-Final-1.pdf (see page 2).

Also, the granting of pardons in Canada is much more orderly whereas, so far as I understand it, it's much more arbitrary in the U.S. and varies state by state.

This is a completely non-obvious issue that you face going to the U.S. and is quite different to what we're used to (it even ensared Conrad Black. Maybe have a read of his comments on the U.S. criminal justice system).

The U.S. has a private prison industry and they don't really care on whose backs they're making profit. Everyone is a target.

mqqm5na,1kf4ynm,Moving from Canada to USA for 170k CAD to 290k USD,askTO,"We moved for my husband‚Äôs job to Seattle (from Vancouver) last year. I sponsored his green card. We save 50% more in the pocket than in Canada (after maxing out our IRA, backdoor, and HSA, etc). He kept the same job as it was a US company with an office in Vancouver. 

Washington state is one of the states with no income tax. Sales tax is higher than most states, but still lower than Canada sales taxes.

Our experience because the company wanted to keep him:
- immediately got a raise as they converted his salary to USD
- he received a 60k retention bonus as his visa was not tied to a company
- US companies typically pay out 90-100% of bonuses, and he has gotten full bonuses each year


Healthcare thru company has been excellent: 
- you pay for what you get (and as my husband puts it, control where it‚Äôs going)
- We are in good health and not on any chronic medications so we chose high-deductible plan as you get to open a Health Savings Plan (triple tax free like a super TFSA)
- I am giving birth this year to our second child so we will hit our 5k deductible (which is also our 5k out of pocket max after which insurance covers everything; preventative and routine care is covered already)
- experience with doctors/dentists has been top notch for us, no long waits nor is it impossible to find a family doctor/pediatrician like in Vancouver 


Credit
- open a US credit card to build up history asap. My husband finally got his score after 6 months. He did a lot of legwork where we opened several cards, have a car loan, opened a small secured loan, report our rent, etc
- calling Experian to get your identity verified is a freaking nightmare, there‚Äôs a hack on Reddit where you hit 2 to call their business customer service and you can talk to an actual person, but it will still be an endless dead end loop

Insurance 
- we got a discount because my parents listed us on their car insurance before we moved
- you will need to change insurance every 6 months, it‚Äôs silly but even with no tickets/accidents‚Ä¶they raised our rates (it‚Äôs a thing in US)
- super easy to switch online and we found a cheaper rate

Tax
- we hired a US accountant and Canadian accountant (two individuals who we have work as a team) as the year we moved we need to file in both countries and it‚Äôs tricky. Paid ~5k total
- we paid tax and moved out our TFSA as that gets taxed by IRS
- RRSPs are not taxed in Washington state
- we own a place in Vancouver, which my SIL serves as the Canadian tax guarantor so we don‚Äôt have to pay non-resident tax on the rental


We have flown a few times to/from Asia and Europe and have had no issues with immigration except for going into secondary for the first time in March for my 2 year old son (his certificate of US citizenship is still in process, but it was still super quick as we were given priority).

We drive up to Vancouver at 1x a month, and never had any issues.

Yes, the govt is currently crazy and lots of things are unpredictable, but the people on the ground are still friendly. I have had people apologize to me for Trump when they hear we recently moved from Canada!

I forget when we are back in Vancouver to not smile and say hi to strangers you walk by. Yes we have dumb and awful Americans, but most people will not be like that.

Anyhow, I love both countries, but the higher salary and take-home (not to mention future opportunities) was a no-brainer for our family in particular.

I'll assume you're aware of the cultural differences, especially right now and have decided that will work for you.



The biggest irritant was healthcare. Dealing with insurance companies and hospitals and multiple Billings etc was super painful and very expensive. If you have family members with complex medical history I would reconsider.


If your partner is planning on getting pregnant, I would seriously consider which state you will be in. If her life is threatened, can she receive medical care at the detriment to the fetus?


They take citizenship weirdly seriously down there. So expect to be treated as an outsider by a ton of businesses. Even getting a fishing license was difficult with a visa.¬†


Quality of food was very different. I found we needed to buy organic everything not just because it was organic but because it contained less sugar and preservatives.¬†


Taxes - get a tax consultation before you go. Understand if you will be a deemed resident, factual resident or non factual resident. Understand if you will be in a position of deemed disposition, and what that entails. Find a CPA who deals in cross border taxes because you will be filing with both agencies and some things will get double taxes.


Finally - understand you will have much fewer worker protections and that turnover can be higher. So avoid lifestyle inflation, save 60-70% of that take-home salary and dump it into an nice S&P 500 ETF and some in Bonds


If the job ends sooner than you would have expected, that will be your cushion.

One thing I can tell you is don‚Äôt buy into the fear mongering they try to sell us about the USA.

Health Insurance is not bad at all, currently it costs me $65 biweekly. Everything is covered with a very small copay at a visit. This is WAY cheaper than paying 40-50% taxes the government in Canada charges for free healthcare.

Car insurance is cheaper than Toronto. When every small neighbourhood street isn‚Äôt getting cars stolen out of their driveways, it does wonders to car insurance rates.

Crime really depends on where you live, compared to Toronto I do live in a much safer area. I could leave my garage open all day and nothing would happen. 

Food is a lot cheaper to go out and eat. But groceries is the big difference, there are grocery options for all income levels you can go to Aldi for cheap options and Wholefoods for premium. In Canada everything costs a lot in every grocery store.

There is a small fear of Mass shootings especially when you hear about it on the news. I can‚Äôt lie it does suck to have to worry about that, but in a country of 330 million people, you are good.

You simply have to file a US return showing how much total you made. The aim is to prevent US citizens from earning money in low/no-tax environments like the UAE and then spending it in the US without paying any tax at all on it, particularly relevant with housing where such a person would gain a massive purchasing advantage over someone who earned domestically and has far less purchasing power because of all the tax they paid.

I understand, if you're a highly skilled worker, you make more money in the US. But there is so much more to life and your ""marginal"" cost of living increase is doing a lot of heavy lifting there if you ever lose benefits and need medical treatment etc.. 

I don't disagree with your statement about Canada's reliance on housing. Our economy has real problems. But there's a reason the US companies pay more, they don't play by the rules. A tax haven only works if it can siphon talent and resources from other areas. You are essentially the resource being siphoned.

If you were living in Poland in 1933, and you got an offer from a company in Nazi Germany making high end planes for the Luftwaffe that paid double what you were currently making, in hindsight would you take that job? 

You talk about prioritizing career, while completely ignoring prioritizing autonomy, freedoms, the right to vote etc.. they are all part of the same system. Making a lot of money means nothing if youre living in a country like the US is currently heading towards. 

No country on earth pays comparable wages to the US. But yet somehow a lot of those countries are way ahead of the US in terms of QoL, happiness, life expectancy etc.

I'm not surprised as a STEM graduate from UofT you struggle to see these factors outside of money and power, that's probably the narrative you've been sold your entire life. Trust me I know, several people in my family are high up engineers and at one point I was on that path to that kind of job.

This summer, starting in July, we're bringing back our free hypnosis nights once a month, but in the meantime we have a [membership program](https://www.morpheusclinic.com/membership) that allows you and a friend to attend as many times as you want.
