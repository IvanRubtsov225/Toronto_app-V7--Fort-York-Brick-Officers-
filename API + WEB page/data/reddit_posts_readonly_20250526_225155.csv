1ksxizb,toronto,"""We Might Have to Close!"" signs popping up on Bathurst","Walking north from Bloor today I spotted about 20 signs, especially as I got closer to Dupont. They were on business doors and windows, implying that the RapidTO project on Bathurst would force them to close. 

Everything from Summerhill Market, plus sized clothing store, a pub, a tattoo parlor, and coffee shops.

Interesting how much support the local businesses are providing against the project.  I work in the area and I would avoid driving here at all costs. Traffic is terrible.

1krypa7,toronto,I LOVE Toronto,"I moved to Toronto about a year ago from London, UK. My partner is from Madrid, and most of our friends are from major cities across Europe, and we have lived all over the world, including the USA. The general consensus is the same, Toronto is a bit colder than we like(especially as I write this), but aside from that, it's INCREDIBLE! 

While it doesn't carry the clout and relevance that NYC or London do, it is a world-class city in every right, and Torontonians need to start taking more pride in that! It has literally everything: beaches, islands, ravines, a stunning skyline, art galleries, international enclaves, breweries, nice people, markets, diverse nightlife opportunities, vintage shopping, great festivals, family-friendly events, and endless live music gigs. It's the perfect blend of American and European lifestyle! 

Don't even get me started on the food scene here! Have you all been keeping Toronto's food scene a secret all this time? 

I could go on and on.

The challenge I’ve run into is that most yin classes tend to be more restorative with shorter holds and a lot of instructor talking.

What I’m actually looking for is something more progressive like a yin yoga class or program that increases hold times over time and focuses more on finding and working with the edge rather than a purely restorative approach.

Maybe that’s not what most yin yoga is meant to be, or maybe what I’m seeking doesn’t exist yet but I thought I’d ask in case anyone knows of a class, teacher or program that aligns more with that style.

I would love some help or any insight on recommendations or places you'd avoid for an apartment. There's so much research I could do but thought why not just ask people who've lived there

**Some loosely-important notes on what I'm looking for**

* **A must**: Need to be somewhat of **a walk/TTC streetcar away from the Subway/1 line** (gotta go to North York sometimes). Don't mind a bit of a commute, but def can't do like Leslieville or Highpark.
* I work in the creative field, and I stay inspired but exploring art galleries, restaurants, music, cool niche stores etc
* I looked into Yorkville/Annex and as nice as it is, cost of living is quite high even if were to land on a well priced unit, if that makes sense (unless I'm wrong)
* I cook a lot, and would love to be in the vicinity of non-corporate owned markets/grocery stores lol
* Bookstores, parks and cafes are my refuge
* Not too big into night life but I don't mind a little noise if it means it's a cool area
* **Rent**: trying to stay between 2200-2400/mth

Please do share any locations you think I should avoid too! Any insight is valuable

I feel like most places here are table service only which is super frustrating, especially if you just want a quick drink, I find it also removes any chance of socializing with other people because everyone’s in their own little bubble. Then if I want to leave I need to wait 10-15 minutes until I can catch the sever to pay, and then I need to pay 18% for the privilege of the inconvenience.

1kqyqmp,askTO,Is there anything else I can do after an armed robbery during a Facebook Marketplace meetup?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to ask for advice after a really unsettling experience. About two weeks ago, I arranged to sell a laptop via Facebook Marketplace and agreed to meet the buyer at a residential address around 8:40 PM. Unfortunately, during the exchange, the buyer pulled a firearm on me and took the item.

I was able to get away without being physically harmed and I called local authorities and spoke with them afterwards. However, as of now, there doesn’t seem to have been any follow-up. What's even more disturbing is that the same person re-listed my laptop on Marketplace right after it happened.

I’m wondering has anyone here dealt with something similar, and is there anything else I can do to push for further action or recover the item? I’ve learned that meeting in a police station parking lot is best, but I wish I had known earlier.

Thanks in advance, and stay safe out there.

1khd5t3,TorontoEvents,"Reddit Toronto May Meetup: Sat. May 17 @ Queen & Broadview, 7:00 p.m. start","Come drink, eat, and hang out with fellow Toronto Redditors looking to make friends and connect on Saturday, May 17, at the Toronto Reddit May meetup - The Long Weekend May 2-4 Edition! It's free to attend and there is no official RSVP, however our reservation requires each person to order something, even if it's just a glass of soda.

We're changing our venue this time to [Duke's Refresher Riverside](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/) at 709 Queen Street East (Queen and Broadview), as our regular venue The Artful Dodger closes their upstairs area over the summer.

If you've never been to a Reddit meetup, everyone is very welcoming and conversations always extend beyond the Reddit platform itself, with no questions about your username. If you are returning, you'll likely recognize some faces, but there are always new folx to meet.

**FAQ:**

* **How do I find the group?:** We'll be on the second level of Duke's Refresher.
* **Am I welcome?:** Everyone is welcome, from visitors to newcomers to people looking to make new friends.
* **Will people my age be there?:** Based on my experiences over the years, the average age of attendees is 20-40.
* **Will women be there?:** Yes! I'm a woman, so you won't be the only woman there.
* **Will I make new friends/connections?:** Everyone who attends is looking for a different experience, but the commonality is getting out, meeting new people and having a good time. I have been attending since 2018 & hosting since 2022. I've made friends I've traveled with and attended some weddings and I still keep in touch with a few out-of-towners. You can make these connections from attending a single (1) meetup (I've seen it happen a lot), so if you're thinking it will be a waste of time to come just once, it's not - anything is possible.
* **How often do you have these events?:** I aim to host one event a month. These have typically been Saturdays starting between 7-8 p.m. I aim to post my events with reasonable notice, including reminders.
* **Does it cost money to attend?:** Though there is no cost to attend the event itself, we ask that you purchase a drink and/or food to support the venue, as they have to turn away other paying customers to fill our reservation. If you do not wish to eat or drink anything, you could tip $5-10 to the staff as a courtesy.
* **What are the food/drink options like?:** There are vegetarian, vegan and non-alcoholic options available, and they are allergy-friendly. [Menu link](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/)
* **Is the venue accessible?** Unfortunately, the venue has stairs and is not fully accessible.

If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment publicly or message me privately. I keep an eye on my account leading up to and during the event, and though I try to respond to messages as soon as possible, I may not be able to reply right away during the event.

If you read all of that, kudos! If not, see TL;DR below.

**TL;DR:** This unofficial Reddit meetup is Saturday, May 17, at 709 Queen Street East (Queen & Broadview). Starts at 7:00 p.m., ends when the last people leave or the bar closes. Everyone is welcome and there is no RSVP, but attendees are required to make a purchase at the venue as part of our reservation's conditions.

Showtime: 11pm

Comedy Bar BLOOR - 945 Bloor Street W, Toronto

Stand-up comedian Andrew Packer (Kill Tony, Man News, +1M Subs on Youtube) teams up with his real-life dad—an actual therapist with over 35 years experience—for a comedy show like no other.

Audience members anonymously submit a real problem/grievance from their life that they want to ""laugh off"". Then, Andrew and a lineup of comedians turn those real-life topics into improvised stand-up, while his dad offers heartfelt (and hilarious) insight from a therapist’s perspective on stage.

It’s raw, real, and ridiculously funny—part stand-up, part therapy and incredibly entertaining.

Last show sold out early—get your tickets now!

Because sometimes the best way to heal… is to laugh it off.

1jfoc08,GTAMarketPlace,Launching Verified Messaging 💬 in goConfirm,"Hey GTA!

There are some awesome shows and festivals coming up in Toronto this summer, and this busy season always brings about more scammers.

As you know, scammers take advantage of the anonymous nature of Reddit. They can use compromised accounts, farm karma, and impersonate others. Ultimately this enables them to “look” trustworthy, commit fraud, and block you. They can keep doing this with little risk of being stopped or face consequences.

This is exactly what Verified Messaging in goConfirm is designed to stop. 

Now once you’ve connected with a potential buyer or seller in goConfirm, you can now use built-in Verified Messaging so you know exactly who you are talking with when exchanging important and sensitive info like payment details or meet-up/shipping logistics.

In the very rare event of fraud, our Fraud Support team has your back. We can take action, because we know exactly who’s involved —including permanent bans.

It’s easy: Like before, create and connect to invite codes for whatever you’re buying or selling. You can share the code in your posts or DMs and ask interested parties to connect.

It’s not just for Reddit, you can use goConfirm in Facebook Groups, Marketplace and WhatsApp.

1kvyk1n,TorontoRealEstate,Feedback Wanted: PH5111 - 38 Widmer | Is Now the Time to Strike or Sit Tight?,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some collective wisdom on this unit:

👉 [PH5111 – 38 Widmer Street (Central Condos)](https://housesigma.com/on/toronto-real-estate/ph5111-38-widmer-street/home/5VXv3lX8wqO3j2q8?id_listing=bEDRYaGDPqP71VaB&utm_campaign=listing&utm_source=user-share&utm_medium=desktop&ign=)

It’s a large penthouse (\~1,900 sq ft, 3 bed/3 bath, two-storey) listed at **$1.88M**, with no parking or locker included in the base price (though parking is a purchase option). The unit is part of **Central Condos by Concord**, which just completed. I’m looking to use this unit partially as a residence when I'm in town, and occasionally as a family pad when they visit. So it’s not a pure investment or pure primary residence.

Here’s what’s making me hesitate:

* **There are currently 15+ units for sale in the same building** — including another penthouse at a similar price, and multiple high-floor units in the $1.0–$1.2M range.
* The building and area have seen a **ton of investor activity**, so I’m cautious about resale liquidity and long-term appreciation.
* Market reports (e.g., TD, WOWA) are predicting **continued downward pressure on GTA condo prices throughout 2025**, especially in oversupplied segments.
* The unit was originally listed in 2023 for nearly $3M — obviously delusional — and has since dropped over $1M. It’s been sitting on the market again for several weeks.

# My current position:.

* I’ve run the affordability numbers; it fits. But I want to avoid catching a falling knife if this market correction has more room to run.
* I’m back in Toronto in June and could act then. Wondering if **waiting until summer might squeeze more desperation out of the seller** or if I risk someone else scooping it up.

**Questions for the hive mind:**

1. **Would you offer now, or wait until June?** Is this sitting long enough to push for a lowball?
2. **How much of a haircut would be reasonable to offer on $1.88M?** Is $1.45M–$1.5M insulting or strategic in this climate?
3. Anyone have insight on **how Concord handles end-of-cycle sales** like this? Do they negotiate directly? Bundle perks like parking or storage?
4. Thoughts on this building’s long-term upside or downside? (It’s positioned well near the tech/financial corridor and Union.)

Appreciate any advice — or horror stories — especially if you’ve transacted in this building or with Concord before. 🙏",0,24,2025-05-26 12:22:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1kvyk1n/feedback_wanted_ph5111_38_widmer_is_now_the_time/,"['The unit', 'though parking']",0.05212053571428574,False,0.43
1kvgmpy,TorontoRealEstate,First Time Home Buyer - Am I on the right track?,"My long-term girlfriend and I currently live in a rental apartment, paying an absurdly low $1400/month because we've been here for over 7 years. However, we both recently had job transfers to the Barrie area, and the hour+ commute and $30-$60 a day in gas (depending on if we can align our schedules to carpool) is wearing us thin. So we are considering buying our first property in the Barrie area instead of paying for another rental. Our finances are as such:

* I make about $4400/month after tax. With bonuses, I can garnish about $5000 extra a year, minimum.
* She makes about $2200/month after tax. This can fluctuate with some piecemeal pay, but that's about the average.
* My grandfather passed away recently, and his will boosted my savings to about $430,000 liquid.
* Her savings are minimal, not enough to meaningfully contribute to a down payment.
* We keep our finances separate, and we plan to continue this. I have seen some strong opinions against this in this sub, but we are both more comfortable this way and unless there are some very strong reasons brought up as to why this is a bad idea, it will be the plan going forward.

My goals are thus:

* We want a fully detached house. Due to the plummeting condo market, questionable build qualities, and our own quality of life, we are looking to avoid condos and townhouses if at all possible.
* I plan to put a substantial downpayment of $300,000 with a maximum price of $700,000. From my research, this will put our mortgage at ~$2,000/month at 5% interest.
* I will use the remaining $130,000 on agent/lawyer fees, inspection, repairs and furnishings, and transfer tax. Whatever is left will be invested, minus an emergency fund.

And I see the timeline as such:

* We will need to obtain separate family lawyers to draw up contracts to keep our finances, and contributions to the property separate. I know some people may disagree, but with me being the massive contributor to the downpayment, we both agree that it would be logical to protect me and my portion of the purchase. **I am a little lost in the woods of how exactly to execute this, so anyone with experience or guidance would be appreciated.**
* We need to find a mortgage broker, to hopefully find the best possible rate in this time of questionable percentages as the national interest rate falls.
* We need to get a real estate agent. I know this isn't explicitly necessary, but it seems to be the path of least resistance. Neither of us really have the time to learn the fine details of executing it without an agent while we both work full time jobs.
* Then...we find the house we want to buy?

I am sure I am missing a ton of detail, and there's a lot of factors I've left out that will change the situation. I am really hoping the wealth of experience in this subreddit can make sure I am on the right track, and point out anything I may have missed or overlooked.

This **isn't** the place to complain about immigrants, newcomers, student visas, (insert ethnicity) people...etc. Complaining won't help you get a job nor will it change the employer's mind. Ragebait posts and comments will be removed and/or banned depending on each moderator's discretion. Posts **without** [Hiring] or [For Hire] tags will be under greater scrutiny and increased risk of removal. Examples:

* Why are there so many (insert ethnicity) working in (insert profession)?
* Immigrant this, newcomer that, student visa this...
* ""Lol. I'm guessing the mods in this sub are refugees.""

**Minimum Wage** - Job Postings that do not pay at least $16.55/h will be removed and/or banned unless exempt under Ontario Law. Posts offering to work below minimum wage will also be removed.

**Disclosure of Pay Rate or Range** - Job Postings that do not explicitly list pay rate/range will be at risk of removal. It is not written in law... yet. But we're not going to wait. Hiding and not disclosing the pay rate/range is a terrible practice and wastes everyone's time.

* Up to each moderator's discretion: If a posting doesn't explicitly list the pay rate/range but does list it in the link, the post is at risk of being removed.

1kw1nxn,TorontoJobs,Left Canada,"There was a viral post in here a bit ago saying how leaving was the better option and wanted to affirm that sentiment. For context, I am a university student at UofT with dual US/Canadian citizenship (raised in Canada). With the latest political climate, I tried hard to land a job in Canada to no avail. I applied online and followed up multiple times with employers with no luck each time. At the beginning of summer when it was becoming clear a job was not going to be found, I very reluctantly came to the decision to seek employment options south of the border. The media in Canada had me very concerned about settling in the states with its perceived volatility and political leadership. Furthermore, the recent “elbows up” of not betraying my country continued to eat away at me.

When searching for employment stateside, difference was night and day. I landed full time employment within 24 hours of looking for work and a week later landed a second part time job (for context this is just across the border in NY). All of my coworkers are in their early 20’s like myself and have all said that all their university friends have had no issues or barriers entering the labour force. 

At the current moment, I am not considering coming back to Canada until things improve. I was barely able to live in Toronto given its high prices. Leveraging the exchange rate, I’m currently able to put nearly $6,000 CAD towards savings every month right now (working between 65-75 hours a week). I say this not to brag but simply to point out how badly the immigration policy in Canada has been constructed and how it’s doing significant damage to the esteem and dreams of Canada’s youth. The youth unemployment level being this high (especially in Ontario) is unacceptable and it’s entirely a massive policy failure that the government cannot continue to ignore (14.1 percent in Canada; 9.6 percent in the US). It will continue the cycle of Canada bleeding talented, qualified individuals to other nations. Furthermore, I write this to affirm people’s suspicions of the significant quality of life differences Americans are currently feeling compared to Canadians. While the United States and Canada have always had their differences, I’ve never seen the gap this wide between our two nations. It’s sad to see Canada in such a tough spot economically and I can only hope government gets their immigration policy together to defend Canada’s youth and Canada’s labour sectors.",434,552,2025-05-26 14:26:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1kw1nxn/left_canada/,"['away', 'I was', 'for context this']",0.0870696512159927,False,0.71
1kw9420,TorontoJobs,Method to get interviews,"Seeing a lot of posts from people having a hard time with the job market and want to share a method I use to get interviews. Works about 25% of the time, though I am not applying to many job ads.

TLDR: Apply to the position through the website so your application is in the applicant tracking system. Then, send an email to the hiring manager to try and get your foot in the door. You could call this a ""cold networking approach."" Here's how it works in more detail:

**1. Apply as regular.** It's unlikely that just putting in an application will ever, even in the best of times, get you an interview except by sheer luck or if you're in a particular industry that favours job seekers.

**2. Look up the hiring manager.** Many job ads list the name of the position that the role will report to, and if not it is something you can often look up on the organization's website. LinkedIn can also be helpful to find the right person, or even a Google search can sometimes find them.

**3. Find their email address.** I find the best way is to do a Google search for ""company name"" and ""email prefix."" In most organizations, it will be something like firstname.lastname at companyname dot com, or firstinitial.last name or just firstname. You will sometimes end up sending a couple of initial emails until you get it right.

**4. Send them the following email:** Hi Name. I applied for a role as nameofrole, which I understand reports directly to you. If it is appropriate, I would love to connect for a quick 10-minute call to learn a little more about this opportunity. I believe I would be a good fit, but have a few questions. Thanks, Yourname.

**5. Attach your cover letter and resume** as a single PDF to the email. They may not open the PDF, as most organizations have trained everyone to never do that, so be sure to also have your email signature link to your LinkedIn or some other platform that they will know and trust.

**6. Assume that they will not respond.** Most hiring managers will open and read your email, but only a small percentage will respond to the initial email. You should plan to send the following email 48 hours later: Hi Name. Just a quick follow-up to my previous email. I'd love to connect if you have a moment. Best, Yourname.

**7. When you get a reply, they will say one of the following:** a) Yes, let's connect for a call. b) No, it isn't appropriate in our process for us to have a call right now. c) Some variation of, How dare you and how did you find my email!  You wouldn't have wanted to work for c), so consider that a bullet dodged. But for a) and b), you have your foot in the door. With a), you can prepare for a very quick call, during which you can ask some questions about the role, and especially to try and learn any pain points for the hiring manager, so you can be ready to share how you will solve those pains when/if you get the formal interview. With b), even though you don't get the call, you've managed to connect directly with the hiring manager and increase your chances of an interview. Overall, for both a) and b), you've demonstrated that you are proactive, a good communicator, and ready to make the hiring manager's job easier.

Once you get the interview, there's obviously a lot more to think about and prepare. I try to interview every few months, even though I'm not really interested in changing jobs, because it's important to keep the skills sharp, and also because it's good for confidence. And finally, better than the above method is a ""warm networking approach,"" in which you would have cultivated the connection with the hiring manager over a period of time and targeted precisely the job and organization you want.

It can be difficult, but keeping a positive mindset and remembering that you are bringing value to any potential employer can make a big difference in these interactions. I wish you all good luck in your job search.",16,5,2025-05-26 19:45:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1kw9420/method_to_get_interviews/,"['I find the best way', 'better than the above method', 'and if not it', 'just putting', 'If it']",0.21294483702571934,False,0.9
1kvzu6s,TorontoJobs,Under 30 Cohort issues with Finding Employment,"I’m in the under 30 cohort and so many of my friends and colleagues can’t find work with uni/college education or trades experience. 

I’ve been unemployed for a year now and I have a masters in health sciences, have worked clinical health roles, research and most recently worked in public health with research and planning. My and other co workers contracts expired at the same as funding ran out and we haven’t been able to find anything since in any field. Most recently, my former manager was hiring for a role I was definitely over qualified for but reached out to get me to apply. I got rejected w/o even an interview or explanation. In the last year it’s like all the jobs vanished and there’s nothing to apply to.

One of my friends has a degree in engineering. Had great co ops, got great connections and overall great person. Been unemployed 1.5 years since graduating and is now a professional fighter who does fights in Asia because that’s the only way he can find work. 

Another friend has his masters in pharmacology and had take reduced hours for medical reasons and eventually got terminated and has been unemployed since over a year ago. Another one in trades drives 4 hours a day for work but can’t move closer bc he can’t afford the rent with his current pay. 

My only friends/colleagues who are employed are in education or nursing, or are in low paying dead end jobs and are on the verge of suicide with substance abuse issues developed only within the last couple years. 

Every person I know under the age of 25 is unemployed despite trying their best to find work. I even know physiotherapists and teachers who graduated in last 2 years who are struggling to find work. Colleagues who work in University co op programs are telling me they’re also facing the largest number of students w/o landing co ops in their history.

I’m only surviving because I live at home and have a side gig training recreational lifters and competitive powerlifters and have had this for years now. It isn’t enough to make a living off, however. I feel like I have no future any more and have no direction.

On top of all this, I have a disability/chronic health issues that make finding sustainable work for me incredibly difficult, and most jobs in the past I’ve tried to just push through because I thought that’s what I had to do in order to get my career started and deal with consequences after things are stable. Now I sit here unemployed and health issues made worse by pushing through it and the stress of finding work, in addition to the loss of some family members this year.

1kvjcir,TorontoJobs,Market is too saturated with temp workers maybe?,"Was checking out Trading Economics for macro indicators and got a bit confused by Canada’s 6.9% unemployment rate. That number feels oddly familiar — like, wasn’t it around the same back in 2016–2017? The thing is, it *feels* very different now. I was a new grad back then, and even without much experience, I’d still get recruiter messages regularly — maybe not every week, but definitely monthly.

Now? Jack shit

It kind of makes sense when you think about population growth, though. Not sure how much of the increase is from new immigrants or temporary residents, but I imagine it’s a factor. Just feels weird seeing similar unemployment numbers but experiencing such a different job market.

Also, when do temporary workers usually end their visa status? And does that get reflected in the official population count somehow?

1ki58la,TorontoJobs,Job Market is BROKEN,"I have been looking for senior PM/BA roles since last fall. I applied to over 200 jobs and went through a few interviews. I did get lucky and landed a decent role recently. My experience and skillset against this role was quite a good fit, but I have concluded that 99% reason why I landed this role was luck. The current employment landscape in Canada is extremely challenging and here is my observsion and journey. By all means this post is NOT a success story to brag about, but a society problem that needs immediate attention. 

Throughout my unemployment journey, I have had the good opportunity to meet a few recruiters and HR friends. They all shared similar feedback on how our jobs system is broken to the core, and quite frankly have no idea how to fix it. As an applicant, I shared my frastration and anxiety. While it has been acknowledged, we agreed this is more Canada’s problem and it will take years to repair, if that’s even fixable. Here are our key takeaways. 

1) The major cities job markets have slowed down since last summer. That said, reputable companies are still hiring. With the popularization of AI, companies are actually leaning more towards middle to senior management, hoping that one strong leader would replace a team. They are being extremely selective with their candidates, often requiring a perfect fit to their expected job description, culture, and personalities. High expectations comes with high price. These jobs typically have good titles, hybrid/remote, and competitive total comp - and companies are generally pretty transparent about this in their postings. But here is the problem…

2) I am sure most people in this community have the following experienced. As early as 2 days after a sought after job is posted, Linkedin displayed 100+ ppl have applied to this job. There you wonder what the actual eff…

Are there that many ppl actively looking for jobs? 
How is it possible everyone has these niche experiences? 

This is pretty demoralizing. So I asked around. 

3) after talking to a few HR friends. Here are their inputs. The reality is often more pathetic than our expectations. If you see there are 100+ ppl applied, often its closer to thousands. Easily 2000+. But thats not the comical part.  You may think ATS does the job to filter out unqualified candidates. Nope. The bad players have evolved. The old trick is to use white fonts to bypass ATS. Now they blatently lie and create perfect resumes tailored for the jobs. Of the 2000+ applicants, 90% of the resumes have almost perfect fit to the job on paper. Gone are the days when your experience is 95% match and still get an interview. That’s just not good enough anymore. Why would they pick you over a bunch of ppl when claim they have done the exact same jobs?

4) so that begs the questions. Who are these qualified/over-qualified people? To answer this question thoroughly, let’s think about your own situation. 

As an applicant legally allowed to work in Canada, when you apply for a job, your goal is obviously to start a nice career with the company that you apply to. Therefore you are honest about your experience and skillsets. You think ahead and envision yourself answering interview questions about your experience, and wish that the hiring manager like you as a person and find you a good fit. Thats the majority of us. The reason why you don’t lie or make shit up is, other than that it’s WRONG, you just never know when this will come back to haunt you. And that’s the moral line we hope to hold in the western civilization. 

4) Now imagine you are not part of the western civilization, or had a taste but on the verge of leaving due to financial reasons. There is NOTHING worse than the current situation stuck in a 3rd world country, or having your work visa expiring in a month - not even getting caught lying down the road. What are the thing that you are willing to put down in your resume to get a call from the recruiter? It’s actually a different game we are playing. We are playing to build a career, they are playing to survive another day. A call from a recruiter and interviews from hiring managers means a golden ticket out of their current situations. 

5) you may ask, don’t they need a work sponsor visa? Yes. And they absolutely check the box. Again, the objective is not about careers. Its about survival. Its about have potential opportunities and discussion to get sponsored. One in a million that they lied about everything but the hiring manager absolutely connected with the candidate. So much so that they would sponsor a work visa and forgive about the lying part. The chance of that happen is not zero and for them its a numbers game. 

6) what does this mean to you? Hiring managers have KPIs. For every fake profile they reviewed, thats one less chance yours get reviewed. Again, you are up against thousands of perfectly tailored applications. Your applications are just buried under a pile of made up candidates. Think PP in Carlton :D

Quite frankly, we need to fix this. Maybe its geofencing to only allow Canadian IP address.  We don’t think this trend is going to stop…it’s a borderline cybersecurity issue and it’s the everyday hardworking Canadians who are impacted the most. I do think though whoever fix this it’s going to be a multi million business because of course US and European companies are affected by job trolls…and this would drastically reduce HR effort and bad hires. 

Also how do I know this is valid? If you have notice the equivalent government jobs that pay decent are actually not affected. Why? Because trolls know governments do not hire ineligible workers. No exceptions.

So employers saw LMI.A as an opportunity to begin their slavery business by charging people who wanted to work for them $50k. and this way, a lot of fake startups started popping out (new businesses get more flexibility to bring cheap labor from another country) and their whole business has been charging people to work for them and sometimes not  actually working for them and instead, just sell them an LMI .A and tell them to go do Uber because that business does not provide any product/service.

these ridiculous LMI. A numbers mislead immigration statistics and numbers and skewed everything and lead to further increased difficulty in getting a PR (higher points required) because the government was already getting lots of immigrants from LMI.A so the required PR points adjust and adapt based on targets. and this became a vicious cycle that started going full on slavery.

Another problem that started was the number of diploma mills opening up to cash in on international student 5x tuition fees and even colleges who used to be reputable, also started going the profit focused route of accepting everyone in their program who is willing to pay a high price. the quality of education then started to drop significantly across all colleges specially during covid when professors would submit 1 week worth of lectures as a single powerpoint file and not care anymore. So this further lead to colleges becoming just a place to use for immigration and colleges gave out diplomas that do not represent actual knowledge. the lack of skill from graduates made legitimate employers avoid hiring lots of these graduates and only hire the ones with experience. and these graduates started going the LMI .A route just to save themselves after spending 5x the tuition for 2-3 years with high cost lf living.

If you agree or understand my points. we can then agree that the root cause is businesses and employers and institutions exploiting the system.

1kq3hjs,TorontoJobs,Told I got the job. Employer reposted job and got 70 people in a day. Has ghosted since.,"Yeah so things are really bad.
I had an interview through a recruiter for a position that on paper shouldn't have been very attractive to most eligible candidates. 
Anyways I needed the job and after the interview per the recruiter, the employer said I got the job and he was drafting an updated offer letter. The only mistake by me in hindsight was during the interview I pushed him to go to his upper end of the salary range and I think that really set him off.

Probably the employer thought he could find cheaper people and posted the job on LinkedIn the day after he spoke to the recruiter. Within a day it had 70 people applied to it before he too it down. This is extremely rare for civil engineering jobs and quite honestly I've seen nothing like it. Especially for this job which is bottom tier of the field at a 5 man company that really only desperate new grads would do. Ever since I havent heard back anything. It's been 5 days now and i think LinkedIn gave him the confidence that he will surely find his wage slave for half the price.

The market is well and truly cooked. Find some other means of making money everyone.

I was taken to Canada at the age of 16, with almost zero knowledge of English language. The English education I received in China was really messed up, it didn't prepare me for the actual English usage at all. So for the three years at Canadian high school I tried my ass off to study and internalize English.

Luckily, I eventually got admitted into UofT, but my unfamiliarity with Western culture let me have little choice beside STEM. At the beginning I chose to do math specialist, but later I realized that it was too hard for me, so I switched to math major and physics major.

Now I am approaching my graduation in June, but I really can't get any response from the job market despite hundreds of resumes sent. Is my decision of doing math and physics a bad choice? Is a cs degree a better choice (I really don't like the way the cs exams are conducted, testing students to hand-write code on paper is too stupid, imo).

1kcsvi3,UofT,Stay far away from Sky Group & Harrington Housing,"UPDATE: After telling them I filed with the LTB and got in contact with journalists, they e-transfered me all my money back LOL. When I handed back the key, I had another Tenant of the same place record the conversation. He agent looked me in the eye with a dead stare and asked “anything you gotta say to me” and I said, good luck in life and I hope you find a real job that doesn’t involve working for crooks. I also reported it to building staff after he left, they’re in for a treat 🤣. 

——————————————————

PLEASE DON'T FALL FOR THIS!!!!!!!  
Sky Group Residence Inc. and its parent company, Harrington Housing, are running an absolute scam. They market rooms (often called “Flex Rooms”) to students and young professionals as fully private bedrooms, but you get a plastic-walled section of a living room with zero privacy, no ceiling coverage, and no lock.

I just got trapped into paying $2,960 upfront (first, last, and an ILLEGAL $600 deposit) for a unit that turned out to be:

• A literal converted living room with plastic sheets and IKEA bookshelves as “walls”

• A sliding plastic door that cost maybe $10 and had no lock

• Walls that didn’t reach the ceiling so that I could hear EVERYTHING from the kitchen and other rooms

• A “private balcony” that’s fully visible from someone else’s bedroom

• No working mailbox access (the key didn’t even work)

When I confronted them, their rep **ADMITTED** it was wrong and said the FaceTime tour guy “does that sometimes.” I have it on audio recording. Then I was handed a phone, and their “manager”, and they told me I could only get my money back if I stayed there for a month and viewed their other units.

So yeah... full-on coercion.

I walked out. Didn’t move in. Applied the Landlord and Tenant Board and submitted everything:

• Audio recordings of their staff admitting it

• Room tour video

• Payment receipts

• Screenshots of the listing and fake reviews

• And a published article exposing these same people on The Local (look it up, they’ve been doing this for YEARS).

,

**They’re targeting:**

• Students

• International renters

• Anyone desperate for affordable housing

If you’re Googling Harrington Housing, Sky Group Residence, or “flex room Toronto”, STAY AWAY.

They’re currently listing places on university housing sites and showing up on Facebook Marketplace, too. Don’t fall for it. **The pictures never show the plastic walls or exposed ceilings. You only find out after they get your money.**

1kcqus4,UofT,"It been a while, I miss her, and it was all my fault, I chickened out","About a month and a half ago, I realized I’d fallen HARD for this girl in my CSC108 class. She’s Chinese (I’m Chinese too, but CBC), and honestly, she was just… different. The kind of student who never touched her phone during lecture, always did the worksheets, even sometimes answered questions, even though English clearly wasn’t her first language. She used to sit with another girl, but I think that girl dropped halfway through the term. That should’ve been my freaking cue.

It’s been a MONTH since our last class. We ended early a class early. She was in a different exam section. But I swear, I think I saw her one last time, maybe sitting on the stairs in Robarts as I walked to my exam. I had 36 minutes to spare, just walking to my room… and I STILL didn’t say anything. I barely glanced for half a second and froze. Classic me.

What really kills me is I had *at least six solid chances* to talk to her once I realized I liked her. SIX. And every time I chickened out. I kept telling myself “next class.” Then the final class rolls around, and she shows up 40 minutes late, looking completely dead, holding a warm bubble tea and sick. She missed the class before too. And I just watched. Like a background NPC.

I had a WHOLE SEMESTER to ask her for her WeChat. And I did nothing. Nothing. Now I’ll probably never see her again. And yes, I made a post about her before on a different account, because she’s literally showing up in my dreams now. I’m going crazy. She was the most attractive, peaceful-looking girl I’ve ever seen and I NEVER even talked to her. Just admired from the sidelines like a passive, awkward dumb\*\*\*.

I hate that I let this happen. I hate the constant “what if” running through my head. My Apple Watch thought I was having a panic attack during that exam walk, last class, and now because of how fast my heart was racing.

I hope she’s doing okay. But I’m absolutely not.  
Maybe I’ll translate this whole mess into Chinese and post it on rednote, who knows. Might as well use my 18 years of Chinese experience on that since I never used it on her.",114,53,2025-05-01 22:56:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1kcqus4/it_been_a_while_i_miss_her_and_it_was_all_my/,"['since I never used it', 'What really kills me']",0.012008281573498961,False,0.84

1kw5gud,yorku,EECS GPA Calculator,"Hello r/yorku

In a personal project, I recently developed a Chrome extension for [York's GPA Calculator](https://apps12.sis.yorku.ca/apps/gpa-calculator/) that filters out all the non-EECS courses for the web app to calculate your EECS GPA.

You can add it here: [EECS GPA Calculator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eecs-gpa-calculator/eeemcnihalgnonmdnomknpbgoheckioa?utm_source=item-share-cb)

# Why did I make this?

Typically in upper year EECS courses, there is a prerequisite regarding your EECS GPA from the Courses Website:

>Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses (without second digit ""5"")

I'm going to my 4th year of Software Engineering, so I have taken (and sometimes bombed) many EECS courses. Since advanced classes become more difficult to maintain your GPA, it's well worth finding out what your EECS GPA is at this point as a ""wake-up call"".

It is also a bit tedious to have to remove every non-EECS class when I use the tool to compute my EECS GPA, so I decided to automate that my making myself an extension.

# Questions & Answers

>How do I add activate the extension?

1. Add the extension to Chrome
2. Click on a puzzle piece icon on the top right next to the Chrome search bar
3. ""EECS GPA Calculator"" should appear in a list, when clicked, a small pop up box should appear
4. Toggle on the extension by clicking on the switch
5. Visit [York's GPA Calculator](https://apps12.sis.yorku.ca/apps/gpa-calculator/) and see the magic happen!

>How do I get all my courses back?

You have to first toggle off the extension in the pop up box, then refresh the calculator page. Doing these two things should have all your courses back on the page.

>I cannot modify or add any courses on the calculator, how can I fix this?

Again, toggle off the extension and reload the page, the web calculator will be working normally again.

>Does it collect or use my data?

No, it has no intention or use of obtaining data from anyone who installs the extension. It has been made clear on the extension page that your data is:

* Not being sold to third parties, outside of the [approved use cases](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/limited-use/)
* Not being used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item's core functionality
* Not being used or transferred to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
