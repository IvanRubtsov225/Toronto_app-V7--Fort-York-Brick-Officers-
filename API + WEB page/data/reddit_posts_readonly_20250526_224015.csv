1ksxizb,toronto,"""We Might Have to Close!"" signs popping up on Bathurst","Walking north from Bloor today I spotted about 20 signs, especially as I got closer to Dupont. They were on business doors and windows, implying that the RapidTO project on Bathurst would force them to close. 

Everything from Summerhill Market, plus sized clothing store, a pub, a tattoo parlor, and coffee shops.

Interesting how much support the local businesses are providing against the project.  I work in the area and I would avoid driving here at all costs. Traffic is terrible. I don't understand why they want to promote such an inefficient mode of transport when a bus lane would bring them more customers, more frequently.",1926,595,2025-05-22 14:05:10,https://i.redd.it/dkgqfg2fid2f1.jpeg,"['Traffic', 'the RapidTO project']",0.08888888888888888,False,0.91

1kt78an,askTO,Why are all pubs and bars table service only? I feel like it kills the vibe.,"I’m from the UK and really miss having just normal pubs where you go up order and drink and find yourself a seat or potter around. I feel like most places here are table service only which is super frustrating, especially if you just want a quick drink, I find it also removes any chance of socializing with other people because everyone’s in their own little bubble. Then if I want to leave I need to wait 10-15 minutes until I can catch the sever to pay, and then I need to pay 18% for the privilege of the inconvenience.

I was in the US recently and even their bars feel more like the UK, it seems like a particularly Canadian thing to have to get table service everywhere.

1khd5t3,TorontoEvents,"Reddit Toronto May Meetup: Sat. May 17 @ Queen & Broadview, 7:00 p.m. start","Come drink, eat, and hang out with fellow Toronto Redditors looking to make friends and connect on Saturday, May 17, at the Toronto Reddit May meetup - The Long Weekend May 2-4 Edition! It's free to attend and there is no official RSVP, however our reservation requires each person to order something, even if it's just a glass of soda.

We're changing our venue this time to [Duke's Refresher Riverside](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/) at 709 Queen Street East (Queen and Broadview), as our regular venue The Artful Dodger closes their upstairs area over the summer.

If you've never been to a Reddit meetup, everyone is very welcoming and conversations always extend beyond the Reddit platform itself, with no questions about your username. If you are returning, you'll likely recognize some faces, but there are always new folx to meet.

**FAQ:**

* **How do I find the group?:** We'll be on the second level of Duke's Refresher.
* **Am I welcome?:** Everyone is welcome, from visitors to newcomers to people looking to make new friends.
* **Will people my age be there?:** Based on my experiences over the years, the average age of attendees is 20-40.
* **Will women be there?:** Yes! I'm a woman, so you won't be the only woman there.
* **Will I make new friends/connections?:** Everyone who attends is looking for a different experience, but the commonality is getting out, meeting new people and having a good time. I have been attending since 2018 & hosting since 2022. I've made friends I've traveled with and attended some weddings and I still keep in touch with a few out-of-towners. You can make these connections from attending a single (1) meetup (I've seen it happen a lot), so if you're thinking it will be a waste of time to come just once, it's not - anything is possible.
* **How often do you have these events?:** I aim to host one event a month. These have typically been Saturdays starting between 7-8 p.m. I aim to post my events with reasonable notice, including reminders.
* **Does it cost money to attend?:** Though there is no cost to attend the event itself, we ask that you purchase a drink and/or food to support the venue, as they have to turn away other paying customers to fill our reservation. If you do not wish to eat or drink anything, you could tip $5-10 to the staff as a courtesy.
* **What are the food/drink options like?:** There are vegetarian, vegan and non-alcoholic options available, and they are allergy-friendly. [Menu link](https://dukesrefresher.ca/riverside/food/)
* **Is the venue accessible?** Unfortunately, the venue has stairs and is not fully accessible.

If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment publicly or message me privately. I keep an eye on my account leading up to and during the event, and though I try to respond to messages as soon as possible, I may not be able to reply right away during the event.

If you read all of that, kudos! If not, see TL;DR below.

your hosts, u/imop44 and u/nervousTO.

**TL;DR:** This unofficial Reddit meetup is Saturday, May 17, at 709 Queen Street East (Queen & Broadview). Starts at 7:00 p.m., ends when the last people leave or the bar closes. Everyone is welcome and there is no RSVP, but attendees are required to make a purchase at the venue as part of our reservation's conditions. I'll be keeping an eye on post comments and my messages between now and Saturday the 17th, so please connect with me if you have any questions.",3,2,2025-05-07 20:33:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1khd5t3/reddit_toronto_may_meetup_sat_may_17_queen/,"['the average age of attendees', ""It's free to attend and there"", ""it's not - anything"", 'but the commonality', 'Everyone who attends', 'feel free to leave a comment', 'This unofficial Reddit meetup', 'the venue has stairs and', 'Everyone is welcome and there', 'closes', 'Though there', 'Everyone', 'ends when the last people leave or the', 'everyone']",0.14831950456950455,False,0.8
1kwakdi,TorontoEvents,I'm throwing a party next to Dundas Square!,"Heyy everyone, I've been lurking this sub for a while now to find events (as we all are) and I'm organizing an open bar rooftop party on the 31st and I thought this would be a perfect place to talk about it (hopefully self promo is allowed here, not sure).

Anyways, my name is Trae, I run these events called Block Party in Montreal and Toronto based on the mentality of throwing house parties at club attendance and amenities. Moving here for university, I found the nightlife scene wasn't the same as my hometown, Toronto seems to be very business oriented versus creating the most enjoyable event for people and I'd like to change that (with my minimal budget and a lot of friends from university). I'm throwing an event called NO FLYERS on the 31st and hopefully people here enjoy the concept of a Toronto event where we're all enjoying ourselves at the same price point, with good music and vibes.

1jfoc08,GTAMarketPlace,Launching Verified Messaging 💬 in goConfirm,"Hey GTA!

There are some awesome shows and festivals coming up in Toronto this summer, and this busy season always brings about more scammers.

As you know, scammers take advantage of the anonymous nature of Reddit. They can use compromised accounts, farm karma, and impersonate others. Ultimately this enables them to “look” trustworthy, commit fraud, and block you. They can keep doing this with little risk of being stopped or face consequences.

This is exactly what Verified Messaging in goConfirm is designed to stop. 

Now once you’ve connected with a potential buyer or seller in goConfirm, you can now use built-in Verified Messaging so you know exactly who you are talking with when exchanging important and sensitive info like payment details or meet-up/shipping logistics.

In the very rare event of fraud, our Fraud Support team has your back. We can take action, because we know exactly who’s involved —including permanent bans.

It’s easy: Like before, create and connect to invite codes for whatever you’re buying or selling. You can share the code in your posts or DMs and ask interested parties to connect.

It’s not just for Reddit, you can use goConfirm in Facebook Groups, Marketplace and WhatsApp.

1b7dt3q,TorontoJobs,"Rules Update: Job Postings, Disclosure of Pay, Appropriate Netiquette, Removal of Ragebait","**Ragebait** - This is a job board, not a workplace demographics report. This **isn't** the place to complain about immigrants, newcomers, student visas, (insert ethnicity) people...etc. Complaining won't help you get a job nor will it change the employer's mind. Ragebait posts and comments will be removed and/or banned depending on each moderator's discretion. Posts **without** [Hiring] or [For Hire] tags will be under greater scrutiny and increased risk of removal. Examples:

* Why are there so many (insert ethnicity) working in (insert profession)?
* Immigrant this, newcomer that, student visa this...
* ""Lol. I'm guessing the mods in this sub are refugees.""

**Minimum Wage** - Job Postings that do not pay at least $16.55/h will be removed and/or banned unless exempt under Ontario Law. Posts offering to work below minimum wage will also be removed.

https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1002886/ontario-increasing-minimum-wage-to-1655-an-hour

**Disclosure of Pay Rate or Range** - Job Postings that do not explicitly list pay rate/range will be at risk of removal. It is not written in law... yet. But we're not going to wait. Hiding and not disclosing the pay rate/range is a terrible practice and wastes everyone's time.

* Up to each moderator's discretion: If a posting doesn't explicitly list the pay rate/range but does list it in the link, the post is at risk of being removed.

1kw1nxn,TorontoJobs,Left Canada,"There was a viral post in here a bit ago saying how leaving was the better option and wanted to affirm that sentiment. For context, I am a university student at UofT with dual US/Canadian citizenship (raised in Canada). With the latest political climate, I tried hard to land a job in Canada to no avail. I applied online and followed up multiple times with employers with no luck each time. At the beginning of summer when it was becoming clear a job was not going to be found, I very reluctantly came to the decision to seek employment options south of the border. The media in Canada had me very concerned about settling in the states with its perceived volatility and political leadership. Furthermore, the recent “elbows up” of not betraying my country continued to eat away at me.

When searching for employment stateside, difference was night and day. I landed full time employment within 24 hours of looking for work and a week later landed a second part time job (for context this is just across the border in NY). All of my coworkers are in their early 20’s like myself and have all said that all their university friends have had no issues or barriers entering the labour force. 

At the current moment, I am not considering coming back to Canada until things improve. I was barely able to live in Toronto given its high prices. Leveraging the exchange rate, I’m currently able to put nearly $6,000 CAD towards savings every month right now (working between 65-75 hours a week). I say this not to brag but simply to point out how badly the immigration policy in Canada has been constructed and how it’s doing significant damage to the esteem and dreams of Canada’s youth. The youth unemployment level being this high (especially in Ontario) is unacceptable and it’s entirely a massive policy failure that the government cannot continue to ignore (14.1 percent in Canada; 9.6 percent in the US). It will continue the cycle of Canada bleeding talented, qualified individuals to other nations. Furthermore, I write this to affirm people’s suspicions of the significant quality of life differences Americans are currently feeling compared to Canadians. While the United States and Canada have always had their differences, I’ve never seen the gap this wide between our two nations. It’s sad to see Canada in such a tough spot economically and I can only hope government gets their immigration policy together to defend Canada’s youth and Canada’s labour sectors.",437,546,2025-05-26 14:26:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1kw1nxn/left_canada/,"['I was', 'away', 'for context this']",0.0870696512159927,False,0.71
1kw9420,TorontoJobs,Method to get interviews,"Seeing a lot of posts from people having a hard time with the job market and want to share a method I use to get interviews. Works about 25% of the time, though I am not applying to many job ads.

TLDR: Apply to the position through the website so your application is in the applicant tracking system. Then, send an email to the hiring manager to try and get your foot in the door. You could call this a ""cold networking approach."" Here's how it works in more detail:

**1. Apply as regular.** It's unlikely that just putting in an application will ever, even in the best of times, get you an interview except by sheer luck or if you're in a particular industry that favours job seekers.

**2. Look up the hiring manager.** Many job ads list the name of the position that the role will report to, and if not it is something you can often look up on the organization's website. LinkedIn can also be helpful to find the right person, or even a Google search can sometimes find them.

**3. Find their email address.** I find the best way is to do a Google search for ""company name"" and ""email prefix."" In most organizations, it will be something like firstname.lastname at companyname dot com, or firstinitial.last name or just firstname. You will sometimes end up sending a couple of initial emails until you get it right.

**4. Send them the following email:** Hi Name. I applied for a role as nameofrole, which I understand reports directly to you. If it is appropriate, I would love to connect for a quick 10-minute call to learn a little more about this opportunity. I believe I would be a good fit, but have a few questions. Thanks, Yourname.

**5. Attach your cover letter and resume** as a single PDF to the email. They may not open the PDF, as most organizations have trained everyone to never do that, so be sure to also have your email signature link to your LinkedIn or some other platform that they will know and trust.

**6. Assume that they will not respond.** Most hiring managers will open and read your email, but only a small percentage will respond to the initial email. You should plan to send the following email 48 hours later: Hi Name. Just a quick follow-up to my previous email. I'd love to connect if you have a moment. Best, Yourname.

**7. When you get a reply, they will say one of the following:** a) Yes, let's connect for a call. b) No, it isn't appropriate in our process for us to have a call right now. c) Some variation of, How dare you and how did you find my email!  You wouldn't have wanted to work for c), so consider that a bullet dodged. But for a) and b), you have your foot in the door. With a), you can prepare for a very quick call, during which you can ask some questions about the role, and especially to try and learn any pain points for the hiring manager, so you can be ready to share how you will solve those pains when/if you get the formal interview. With b), even though you don't get the call, you've managed to connect directly with the hiring manager and increase your chances of an interview. Overall, for both a) and b), you've demonstrated that you are proactive, a good communicator, and ready to make the hiring manager's job easier.

Once you get the interview, there's obviously a lot more to think about and prepare. I try to interview every few months, even though I'm not really interested in changing jobs, because it's important to keep the skills sharp, and also because it's good for confidence. And finally, better than the above method is a ""warm networking approach,"" in which you would have cultivated the connection with the hiring manager over a period of time and targeted precisely the job and organization you want.

It can be difficult, but keeping a positive mindset and remembering that you are bringing value to any potential employer can make a big difference in these interactions. I wish you all good luck in your job search.",13,4,2025-05-26 19:45:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1kw9420/method_to_get_interviews/,"['I find the best way', 'just putting', 'If it', 'better than the above method', 'and if not it']",0.21294483702571934,False,0.88
1kvzu6s,TorontoJobs,Under 30 Cohort issues with Finding Employment,"I’m in the under 30 cohort and so many of my friends and colleagues can’t find work with uni/college education or trades experience. 

I’ve been unemployed for a year now and I have a masters in health sciences, have worked clinical health roles, research and most recently worked in public health with research and planning. My and other co workers contracts expired at the same as funding ran out and we haven’t been able to find anything since in any field. Most recently, my former manager was hiring for a role I was definitely over qualified for but reached out to get me to apply. I got rejected w/o even an interview or explanation. In the last year it’s like all the jobs vanished and there’s nothing to apply to.

One of my friends has a degree in engineering. Had great co ops, got great connections and overall great person. Been unemployed 1.5 years since graduating and is now a professional fighter who does fights in Asia because that’s the only way he can find work. 

Another friend has his masters in pharmacology and had take reduced hours for medical reasons and eventually got terminated and has been unemployed since over a year ago. Another one in trades drives 4 hours a day for work but can’t move closer bc he can’t afford the rent with his current pay. 

My only friends/colleagues who are employed are in education or nursing, or are in low paying dead end jobs and are on the verge of suicide with substance abuse issues developed only within the last couple years. 

Every person I know under the age of 25 is unemployed despite trying their best to find work. I even know physiotherapists and teachers who graduated in last 2 years who are struggling to find work. Colleagues who work in University co op programs are telling me they’re also facing the largest number of students w/o landing co ops in their history.

I’m only surviving because I live at home and have a side gig training recreational lifters and competitive powerlifters and have had this for years now. It isn’t enough to make a living off, however. I feel like I have no future any more and have no direction.

On top of all this, I have a disability/chronic health issues that make finding sustainable work for me incredibly difficult, and most jobs in the past I’ve tried to just push through because I thought that’s what I had to do in order to get my career started and deal with consequences after things are stable. Now I sit here unemployed and health issues made worse by pushing through it and the stress of finding work, in addition to the loss of some family members this year.

1kvjcir,TorontoJobs,Market is too saturated with temp workers maybe?,"Was checking out Trading Economics for macro indicators and got a bit confused by Canada’s 6.9% unemployment rate. That number feels oddly familiar — like, wasn’t it around the same back in 2016–2017? The thing is, it *feels* very different now. I was a new grad back then, and even without much experience, I’d still get recruiter messages regularly — maybe not every week, but definitely monthly.

Now? Jack shit

It kind of makes sense when you think about population growth, though. Not sure how much of the increase is from new immigrants or temporary residents, but I imagine it’s a factor. Just feels weird seeing similar unemployment numbers but experiencing such a different job market.

Also, when do temporary workers usually end their visa status? And does that get reflected in the official population count somehow?

1kk4myz,TorontoJobs,Your resume and LinkedIn might be holding you back,"Context: I’m a hiring manager that is currently reviewing 500+ applicants for 2 roles at a marketing agency. 

I don’t want to downplay the current job market, and am only posting this to hopefully help at least one person out there be a better applicant. I expect to potentially be downvoted to all hell but it needs to be said - you might be in your own way in your job journey. 

Your resume - the roles I hire for require high attention to detail. If there are errors and inconsistency in your spelling and grammar, I just can’t consider you, as from the get go, you aren’t even marketing yourself well. 

LinkedIn - it’s also wild how minimal information is here. Most people will add their LinkedIn… hiring managers do actually go here and how you present yourself there also matters and can play a big factor in hiring decisions. 

For both of these, highly suggest you to leverage friends to proof-read or provide suggestions. You can also PDF your LinkedIn and run it through ChatGPT for suggestions and optimization efforts. 

FWIW - for the one role which is Director level, about 40-50 of the 350 applicants had relevant experience, and more than half of those people had resumes that had spelling and grammatical errors so I had to filter them out.

1ki58la,TorontoJobs,Job Market is BROKEN,"I have been looking for senior PM/BA roles since last fall. I applied to over 200 jobs and went through a few interviews. I did get lucky and landed a decent role recently. My experience and skillset against this role was quite a good fit, but I have concluded that 99% reason why I landed this role was luck. The current employment landscape in Canada is extremely challenging and here is my observsion and journey. By all means this post is NOT a success story to brag about, but a society problem that needs immediate attention. 

Throughout my unemployment journey, I have had the good opportunity to meet a few recruiters and HR friends. They all shared similar feedback on how our jobs system is broken to the core, and quite frankly have no idea how to fix it. As an applicant, I shared my frastration and anxiety. While it has been acknowledged, we agreed this is more Canada’s problem and it will take years to repair, if that’s even fixable. Here are our key takeaways. 

1) The major cities job markets have slowed down since last summer. That said, reputable companies are still hiring. With the popularization of AI, companies are actually leaning more towards middle to senior management, hoping that one strong leader would replace a team. They are being extremely selective with their candidates, often requiring a perfect fit to their expected job description, culture, and personalities. High expectations comes with high price. These jobs typically have good titles, hybrid/remote, and competitive total comp - and companies are generally pretty transparent about this in their postings. But here is the problem…

2) I am sure most people in this community have the following experienced. As early as 2 days after a sought after job is posted, Linkedin displayed 100+ ppl have applied to this job. There you wonder what the actual eff…

Are there that many ppl actively looking for jobs? 
How is it possible everyone has these niche experiences? 

This is pretty demoralizing. So I asked around. 

3) after talking to a few HR friends. Here are their inputs. The reality is often more pathetic than our expectations. If you see there are 100+ ppl applied, often its closer to thousands. Easily 2000+. But thats not the comical part.  You may think ATS does the job to filter out unqualified candidates. Nope. The bad players have evolved. The old trick is to use white fonts to bypass ATS. Now they blatently lie and create perfect resumes tailored for the jobs. Of the 2000+ applicants, 90% of the resumes have almost perfect fit to the job on paper. Gone are the days when your experience is 95% match and still get an interview. That’s just not good enough anymore. Why would they pick you over a bunch of ppl when claim they have done the exact same jobs?

4) so that begs the questions. Who are these qualified/over-qualified people? To answer this question thoroughly, let’s think about your own situation. 

As an applicant legally allowed to work in Canada, when you apply for a job, your goal is obviously to start a nice career with the company that you apply to. Therefore you are honest about your experience and skillsets. You think ahead and envision yourself answering interview questions about your experience, and wish that the hiring manager like you as a person and find you a good fit. Thats the majority of us. The reason why you don’t lie or make shit up is, other than that it’s WRONG, you just never know when this will come back to haunt you. And that’s the moral line we hope to hold in the western civilization. 

4) Now imagine you are not part of the western civilization, or had a taste but on the verge of leaving due to financial reasons. There is NOTHING worse than the current situation stuck in a 3rd world country, or having your work visa expiring in a month - not even getting caught lying down the road. What are the thing that you are willing to put down in your resume to get a call from the recruiter? It’s actually a different game we are playing. We are playing to build a career, they are playing to survive another day. A call from a recruiter and interviews from hiring managers means a golden ticket out of their current situations. 

5) you may ask, don’t they need a work sponsor visa? Yes. And they absolutely check the box. Again, the objective is not about careers. Its about survival. Its about have potential opportunities and discussion to get sponsored. One in a million that they lied about everything but the hiring manager absolutely connected with the candidate. So much so that they would sponsor a work visa and forgive about the lying part. The chance of that happen is not zero and for them its a numbers game. 

6) what does this mean to you? Hiring managers have KPIs. For every fake profile they reviewed, thats one less chance yours get reviewed. Again, you are up against thousands of perfectly tailored applications. Your applications are just buried under a pile of made up candidates. Think PP in Carlton :D

Quite frankly, we need to fix this. Maybe its geofencing to only allow Canadian IP address.  We don’t think this trend is going to stop…it’s a borderline cybersecurity issue and it’s the everyday hardworking Canadians who are impacted the most. I do think though whoever fix this it’s going to be a multi million business because of course US and European companies are affected by job trolls…and this would drastically reduce HR effort and bad hires. 

Also how do I know this is valid? If you have notice the equivalent government jobs that pay decent are actually not affected. Why? Because trolls know governments do not hire ineligible workers. No exceptions.

I was taken to Canada at the age of 16, with almost zero knowledge of English language. The English education I received in China was really messed up, it didn't prepare me for the actual English usage at all. So for the three years at Canadian high school I tried my ass off to study and internalize English.

Luckily, I eventually got admitted into UofT, but my unfamiliarity with Western culture let me have little choice beside STEM. At the beginning I chose to do math specialist, but later I realized that it was too hard for me, so I switched to math major and physics major.

Now I am approaching my graduation in June, but I really can't get any response from the job market despite hundreds of resumes sent. Is my decision of doing math and physics a bad choice? Is a cs degree a better choice (I really don't like the way the cs exams are conducted, testing students to hand-write code on paper is too stupid, imo).

What should I do next? Any experience from those experienced?",243,159,2025-04-30 16:03:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1kbpxoe/24_years_old_math_and_physics_majors_graduating/,['testing students to hand-write code on paper'],0.026631944444444458,False,0.98

1i60muf,yorku,Spots for York University,"Hi All,

Me and a couple friends made [https://spots.yorku.dev/](https://spots.yorku.dev/) for YorkU.

Finding the perfect spot to study on York University's massive campus can feel overwhelming. Despite the abundance of empty classrooms, these spaces often go underutilized.

Thats why we built spots.yorku.dev. Features include:

* Expand buildings to see the status of rooms.
* Buildings are sorted by your current location for convenience.
* Explore an interactive map with clickable pins for building details.
* Find library spaces and even book empty rooms through handy links.

Shout out to Akhsar Barot’s Spots for the inspiration, and SSADC for their support :)",53,5,2025-01-20 15:48:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/1i60muf/spots_for_york_university/,['Shout out to Akhsar'],0.3,False,0.98
1kw5gud,yorku,EECS GPA Calculator,"Hello r/yorku

In a personal project, I recently developed a Chrome extension for [York's GPA Calculator](https://apps12.sis.yorku.ca/apps/gpa-calculator/) that filters out all the non-EECS courses for the web app to calculate your EECS GPA.

You can add it here: [EECS GPA Calculator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eecs-gpa-calculator/eeemcnihalgnonmdnomknpbgoheckioa?utm_source=item-share-cb)

# Why did I make this?

Typically in upper year EECS courses, there is a prerequisite regarding your EECS GPA from the Courses Website:

>Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses (without second digit ""5"")

I'm going to my 4th year of Software Engineering, so I have taken (and sometimes bombed) many EECS courses. Since advanced classes become more difficult to maintain your GPA, it's well worth finding out what your EECS GPA is at this point as a ""wake-up call"".

It is also a bit tedious to have to remove every non-EECS class when I use the tool to compute my EECS GPA, so I decided to automate that my making myself an extension.

# Questions & Answers

>How do I add activate the extension?

1. Add the extension to Chrome
2. Click on a puzzle piece icon on the top right next to the Chrome search bar
3. ""EECS GPA Calculator"" should appear in a list, when clicked, a small pop up box should appear
4. Toggle on the extension by clicking on the switch
5. Visit [York's GPA Calculator](https://apps12.sis.yorku.ca/apps/gpa-calculator/) and see the magic happen!

>How do I get all my courses back?

You have to first toggle off the extension in the pop up box, then refresh the calculator page. Doing these two things should have all your courses back on the page.

>I cannot modify or add any courses on the calculator, how can I fix this?

Again, toggle off the extension and reload the page, the web calculator will be working normally again.

>Does it collect or use my data?

No, it has no intention or use of obtaining data from anyone who installs the extension. It has been made clear on the extension page that your data is:

* Not being sold to third parties, outside of the [approved use cases](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/limited-use/)
* Not being used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item's core functionality
* Not being used or transferred to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes

1kw3su7,yorku,Deciding which university is best for me,"Hi, I'm currently in grade 12 trying to decide which uni to go to. I have to commute from home as I can't live on campus and so my choices are between york bio keele campus (1hr20 commute one way ) and lakehead life sci at the orillia campus (50min commute one way); trying to avoid McMaster and UofT as they are too far (1.8 - 2.5 hr commute one way). I am currently planning on doing med school after uni and know that I need a high gpa as well as publications. Would lakehead be a good choice for pre med, as in would I be able to find some research opportunities?

1kcjlx5,yorku,For the first time in a long time I am kinda proud of myself.,"I turned 28 last December, and I’m graduating this June with an Honours BA in Psychology. For a long time, I felt like I was too old to still be in undergrad. No matter how well or poorly I was doing academically, I carried a weird sense of shame about being on campus or sitting in class. But today, I was looking over my grades, and honestly… I felt proud. I realized I actually did pretty well. And maybe not everyone is this good at school? I don’t know. Either way, it feels nice to give myself a bit of credit. It’s just an undergrad degree, but it still means something—and that’s kind of cool.
Now I’m about to start my graduate school journey, though I’m still deciding whether to stick with psychology or pivot to a marketing degree. Either way, I’m excited (and nervous) for what’s next.

P.S. I’ve attached a screenshot of my grades—just curious to hear from other psych students: is this around the level you’re at too?
